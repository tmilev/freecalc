# Freecalc

Freecalc is a LaTeX/postscript project aimed at creating high quality educational materials used for teaching 
Precalculus, Calculus and Multivariable Calculus at the university level. 

There are 3 types of materials: 
- slides, intended for teaching in class with projector, 
- homework problem collections, 
- textbook [work in progress]. 

## Projector Slides
These are intended for teaching in class with projector, with or without the aid of additional blackboard work. 

- Educational aspects:
-- Both example problems and theoretical considerations are presented in a step by step fashion. 
-- Each slide is uncovered gradually, showing one step at a time. Some slides have upwards of 60 separate steps. 
-- Various aspects of the comptuations are highlighted on and off depending on their use in the last computation step. 
-- Problems of considerable technical difficulty are presented in full detail.
-- While doing computations, some computation entries are initially marked with a question mark, 
prompting the students to guess what going to be uncovered in the next step. 
-- The slides have high quality step-by-step drawn graphics with LaTeX formula labels, achieving the 
effect of highest-quality blackboard graphics. 
-- The 3d graphics are drawn using orthographic projections, with dashed background contours and 
with viewing depth color shading. The quality is higher than most commercially available textbooks.
-- All graphics are accurately drawn in accordance with the problem.  
quality than most mathematical textbooks. 
- Technical aspects:
-- Each slide comes in pdf format. 
-- Each slide phase is a separate pdf page. The slides display correctly out-of-the-box
on every computer/projector combination we have tried so far, as well as on every student laptop we have seen.
-- The 2d and 3d graphics are programmed directly in the LaTeX files, and can be edited directly in your favorite
LaTeX editor. 
-- The postscript graphics are coordinated with the LaTeX content using standard \uncover<> commands.
