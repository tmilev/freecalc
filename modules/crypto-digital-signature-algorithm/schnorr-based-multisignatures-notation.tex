\begin{itemize}
\item To generate a multi-signature (aggregate signature) means to have independent parties combine their signatures into a single smaller signature.
\item We describe several Schnorr-based multi-signatures. 
\item Schnorr-based multi-signature schemes assumptions:
\begin{emptyTheorem}[Schnorr-based multi-signature setup]
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal G$ - cyclic group with generator $g$, $\left|\mathcal G\right| = p$ prime.
\item Secrets $\mathrm{secret}_1, \dots, \mathrm{secret}_n $ corresponding to public keys $\mathrm{pub}_1 = g^{\mathrm{secret}_1}, \dots, \mathrm{pub}_n = g^{\mathrm{secret}_n}.$
\end{itemize}
\end{emptyTheorem}
\item The secrets $\mathrm{secret}_i$ are assumed to have distinct owners. 
\item Communication between key owners happens over open network. 
\item Malicious signers may craft $\left(\mathrm{secret}_i, \mathrm{pub}_i\right)$ to attack the system.
\end{itemize}
