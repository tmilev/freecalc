\item Is the number $67414977753059$ prime? \uncover<2->{\alertNoH{2}{No}}
\[
{\onlyNoH{1}{\color{white}} \underbrace{\color{black}67414977753059}_{\alertNoH{2}{\text{not prime}}}} = \uncover<6->{\alertNoH{6}{  \underbrace{ 11494253}_{ \text{prime}} \cdot \underbrace{ 5865103}_{\text{prime}} }}
\]
\item<3-> Even when $x$ is large, there exist \alertNoH{3}{fast computer algorithms} to check whether $x$ is prime.
\item<4-> In other words, there exist fast algorithms for knowing whether a proper factorization exists.
\item<5-> However, even when we know \alertNoH{5}{$x$ can be factored}, as of 2019, there are \alertNoH{6}{no known fast computer algorithms} for \alertNoH{6}{finding an actual factorization}.
\item<7-> In fact, the number above was generated by first making two large primes and then multiplying them. 
\item<8-> Each of the two known large primes above was in turn generated by trying large integers at random.
