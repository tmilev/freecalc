\begin{itemize}
\item There exists an algorithm for simplifying every fraction. 
\item<2-> The algorithm involves the notion of a greatest common divisor.
\item<3-> We will study greatest common divisors later.
\item<4-> The fraction simplification algorithm is well-suited for and very fast on a computer. 
\item<5-> The standard algorithm is practical for use by hand.
\item<6-> However on small examples the guess-work technique shown in examples is faster for a human.
