\begin{itemize}
\item There exists an algorithm for simplifying every fraction. 
\item<2-> The algorithm is considerably different from what we exercised so far: it does not require us to factor the numerator and denominator.
\item<3-> Instead, the algorithm involves the notion of a greatest common divisor (GCD).
\item<4-> We will study greatest common divisors (GCD) and the fraction simplification GCD algorithm later.
\item<5-> That fraction simplification GCD algorithm is well-suited for and very fast on a computer. 
\item<6-> This algorithm is also practical for use by hand.
\item<7-> However on small examples the factorization-cancellation guess-work technique shown in examples is faster for a human.
