\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce multiple-digit divisors. 
\item The multi-digit division algorithm is similar to the one-digit divisor, with some differences.
\begin{itemize}
\item The multi-digit division uses the \alertNoH{2}{leading digit of the divisor plus one}, where as the single-digit division uses leading digit as is.
\item An extra step to collect the quotient digits is needed.
\end{itemize}
