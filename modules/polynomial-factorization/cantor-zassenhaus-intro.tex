\begin{itemize}
\item The \alertNoH{1}{Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm} is an algorithm for efficient \alertNoH{1,3}{factorization} of a polynomial $f$ as a product of \alertNoH{2}{irreducibles} in \alertNoH{1}{$\mathbb Z[x]$}.
\item<2-> \alertNoH{2}{Irreducible polynomial = polynomial that can't be factored in an essential fashion}.
\item<3-> To \alertNoH{3}{factor a polynomial $f$} = write it as \alertNoH{3}{product of irreducibles}.
\item<4-> Irreducible factors of $g$ \alertNoH{4}{different degree} can be found quickly+efficiently.
\item<5-> The C-Z algorithm deals with factors of same degree.
\item<6-> The C-Z algorithm is a probabilistic, every run gives $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of (partial) factorization.
