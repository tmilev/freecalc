\begin{itemize}
\item We just described a plan for extracting a factorization over $\mathbb Z$ from a factorization $\mod p$.
\item The plan had a few problems / open questions.
\begin{itemize}
\item How to choose the prime $p$?
\item How to efficiently factor $\mod p$? 
\item What happens when factoring $\mod p$ yields more factors than we have over $\mathbb Z$?
\item \alert<1->{How does one choose $n$ large enough so that factorization $\mod p^n$ helps us read off factorization over $\mathbb Z$?}
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}
How does one choose $n$ large enough so that factorization $\mod p^n$ helps us read off factorization over $\mathbb Z$?
\end{question}

\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> Let $g$ be a factor of $f$. 
\item<3-> To convert coefficients of a factor over $\mathbb Z_{p^n}[x]$ to coefficients over $\mathbb Z$:
\item<4-> $\Rightarrow$ we need that $\frac{p^n}{2}$ be larger than the absolute value of each coefficient of $g $.
\item<5-> Let $G$ be the largest absolute value of a coefficient of $g$. Let $F$ be the largest absolute value of a coefficient of $f$.
\uncover<6->{
\begin{lemma}[Mahler: Gelfond's inequality]
$G \leq 2^{\deg f-1} \sqrt{\deg f+1} F$
\end{lemma}
}
\item<7-> The proof is not very easy. See inequality (II), K. Mahler, On some inequalities for polynomials in several variables, Journal London Mathematical Society 37, 1962, pages 341-344.
