\begin{itemize}
\item We just described a plan for extracting a factorization over $\mathbb Z$ from a factorization $\mod p$.
\item The plan had a few problems / open questions.
\begin{itemize}
\item How to choose the prime $p$?
\item \alert<1->{How to efficiently factor $\mod p$?}
\item What happens when factoring $\mod p$ yields more factors than we have over $\mathbb Z$?
\item How does one choose $n$ large enough so that factorization $\mod p^n$ helps us read off factorization over $\mathbb Z$?
\end{itemize}
