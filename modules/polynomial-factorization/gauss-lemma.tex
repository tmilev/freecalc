\begin{theorem}[Gauss lemma]
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients and let 
\[
p(x)=q(x)\cdot r(x)
\] be a factorization so that $q$ and $r$ have rational coefficients. Then $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ can be re-scaled with multiplication by a constant to 
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar q(x) &=& c\cdot q(x)\\ 
\bar r(x) &=& \frac{1}{c} \cdot r(x)\\
p&=&\bar r(x)\bar q(x)
\end{array}
\] so that both $\bar q(x),\bar r(x)$ have integer coefficients.
