\begin{itemize}
\item Consider $f(x)=x^{4}-11 x^{2}+1$. 
\item<2-> If it has rational roots, then they must be $\pm 1$ by the rational root theorem, but $f(-1)=f(1)=-9$. So the polynomial has no rational roots. 
\item<3-> We need a general method to factor $f$.
\item<4-> One such method is the Kronecker algorithm.
\end{itemize}
