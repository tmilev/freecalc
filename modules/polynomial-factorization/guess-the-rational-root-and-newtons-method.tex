Example: $\alertNoH{1}{6}x^3-19x^2+17x\alertNoH{1}{-3}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Guessing rational roots: had to factor constant term, leading coefficient.
\item<2-> We wrote down all possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item<3-> Even on small example we get many possibilities!
\end{itemize}
\item<4-> An optimization: use numerical methods (say: Newton's method) to find floating point approximation for the root.
\item<5-> Say, we found $r=1.499$.
\item<6-> If root is rational, then its leading coefficient $6$ times $r$ is integer.
\item<7-> So: $1.499\cdot 6=8.994$. 

\item<8-> Round $8.944$ to nearest integer: $9$. 
\item<9-> Divide $9$ back by $6$ to get $\frac{3}{2}$. 
\item<10-> Now $\frac{3}{2}$: rational number close $r$.
\item<11-> In our algebra method, start with $\frac{3}{2}$ as our first guess. 
\end{itemize}
