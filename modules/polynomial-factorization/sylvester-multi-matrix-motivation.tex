\begin{itemize}
\item When doing Hensel lifts of $h\in \mathbb Z[x]$ with more than 2 co-prime factors: $a_1\cdot a_2 \cdots a_k \mod p $
we could:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> Group into two factors: $a_1 \cdot \left(a_2\cdots a_k\right) $.
\item<3-> Lift $a_1$ to $d_1 \mod p^n$.
\item<4-> Compute $h_1 = \frac{h}{d_1 } \mod p^n$ - this is a polynomial as $h$ is divisible by $d_1$).
\item<5-> Apply the same procedure to lift $a_2$ relative to $h_1$, and so on by recursion.
\end{itemize}
\item<6-> This is uncomfortable to work with: let's do the lift with all $k$ factors simultaneously. 
\end{itemize}
