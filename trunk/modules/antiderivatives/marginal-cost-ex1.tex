\begin{frame}{Total vs. Marginal Cost}

Consider the cost function $C(x)$ of a manufacturer (the dollar cost of producing $ x $ units of a particular product or commodity).\\
The derivative $ C'(x) $ is called the \textbf{marginal cost}. The cost of increasing production from $ a $ to $ b $ is the \textbf{net change} $C(b) - C(a)$, which is equal to the integral of the marginal cost:\\

\begin{center}
Cost of increasing production levels from $a$ to $b$ $ = \ds \int_a^b C'(x)\,dx$.
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{example}
The marginal cost of producing $x$ computer chips 
(in units of $1000$) is $C'(x) = 300x^2 - 4000x + 40000$ (dollars per thousand chips).\\
{\bf{(a)}} Find the cost of increasing production from 10,000 to 15,000 chips.\\

{\bf{(b)}} Determine the total cost of producing 15,000 chips, assuming that it costs \$30,000 to set up the manufacturing run 
[that is, $C(0) = 30,000$].\\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
\pause 
{\bf{(a)}} The cost of increasing production from 10,000 ($x$ = 10) to  15,000 ($x$ = 15) is
\[
C(15)-C(10) \pause =\int_{10}^{15} C'(x) dx \pause =\int_{10}^{15} (300x^2-4000x+40000)\;dx
\]
\[
= \left(100x^3-2000x^2+40000x\right|_{10}^{15}
\]
\[
=487500-300000=187,500
\]
So the cost of increase is \$187,500.

\begin{example}
The marginal cost of producing $x$ computer chips 
(in units of $1000$) is $C'(x) = 300x^2 - 4000x + 40000$ (dollars per thousand chips).\\
{\bf{(a)}} Find the cost of increasing production from 10,000 to 15,000 chips.\\

{\bf{(b)}} Determine the total cost of producing 15,000 chips, assuming that it costs \$30,000 to set up the manufacturing run 
[that is, $C(0) = 30,000$].\\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
\pause 
{\bf{(a)}} The cost of increasing from 0 to 15,000 chips is
\[
C(15)-C(0) \pause =\int_{0}^{15} C'(x) dx \pause =\int_{0}^{15} (300x^2-4000x+40000)\;dx
\]
\[
= \left(100x^3-2000x^2+40000x\right|_{0}^{15}
\]
\[
=\$487,500
\]
The total cost of producing 15,000 chips includes the set-up costs of \$30,000:
\[
C (15) = C (0) + 487,500   =    30,000 + 487,500   =   \$517,500
\]
