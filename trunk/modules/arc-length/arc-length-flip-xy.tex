If a curve has equation $x = g(y)$, $c\leq y \leq d$, and $g'(y)$ is continuous, then we can get the length of the curve by interchanging the roles of $x$ and $y$ in the arc length formula:
\[
L = \int_c^d \sqrt{1+(g'(y))^2}\ \diff y = \int_c^d \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{\diff x}{\diff y}\right)^2}\ \diff y
\]
