\begin{itemize}
\item Let $z=f(x,y)$ be differentiable function let $P_0(x_0, y_0)$ be a point.
\item The graph of $f(x,y)$ is the surface $S=\{(x,y, f(x,y)) \} $.
\item We studied that plane tangent to $S$ at $(x_0, y_0, f(x_0 , y_0 ))$ is the space passing through that point and parallel to the tangent vectors of all curves on $S$.
\item Let $\fcv r(t)$ be a differentiable curve in the $(x,y)$ - plane passing through $x_0, y_0$ at $t=0$:
\[
\fcv (r)(t)= \langle r_1(t), r_2(t) \rangle, r_1(0)=x_0, r_2(0)=y_0\quad  .
\]
\item Every smooth curve on $S$ is of that form - the corresponding $\fcv r$ - curve in the $(x,y)$ plane is its projection.
\item Then $\fcv r(t)$
\[
(r_1(t), r_2(t), )
\]
