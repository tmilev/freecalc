Let $z=f(x,y)$ and $x=r\cos\theta$, $y=r\sin\theta$. Then
%
$$z=f(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) = g(r, \theta) \; .$$
%
$P(x,y) = P(r,\theta)$. Compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial r}$ at $P$:
%
$$\xymatrix{
 &   &        & z &    &   & \\
 & x \ar[urr] &        &   &    & y \ar[ull] & \\
r\ar[ur]&   & \theta \ar[ul]&   &  r\ar[ur] &   & \theta \ar[ul]
}$$
%
$
  \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial} z}{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial r}} (P) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} (P)\frac{\partial x}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}(P) \frac{\partial y}{\partial r} = \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial} z}{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial x}}(P) \cos\theta + \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial} z}{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\partial y}} (P) \sin\theta
$
%
hence
%
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial r} = \cos\theta\frac{\partial }{\partial x}  + \sin\theta\frac{\partial }{\partial y} $$
