$$dw=w_x(x,y,z)\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{dx} +
w_y(x,y,z)\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{dy}+
w_z(x,y,z)\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,0.00}{dz}$$

and

$$\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{\diff x=x'(t)dt} \qquad
\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{\diff y = y'(t)dt} \qquad
\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,0.00}{\diff z=z'(t)dt} \; .$$

\pause Then
%
$$dw = \left( w_x(x,y,z) x'(t) + w_y(x,y,z) y'(t) +
w_z(x,y,z) z'(t) \right) \diff t$$

Therefore
%
$$\frac{dw}{\diff t}(t) = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}(x,y,z) \frac{\diff x}{\diff t}(t) +
\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}(x,y,z) \frac{\diff y}{\diff t}(t) +
\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}(x,y,z) \frac{\diff z}{\diff t}(t)$$
