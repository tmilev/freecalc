$$\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{dx=x'(t)dt} \qquad
\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{dy = y'(t)dt} \qquad
\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,0.00}{dz=z'(t)dt} \; .$$

\pause Then
%
$$dw = \left( w_x(x,y,z) x'(t) + w_y(x,y,z) y'(t) +
w_z(x,y,z) z'(t) \right) dt$$

Therefore
%
$$\frac{dw}{dt}(t) = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}(x,y,z) \frac{dx}{dt}(t) +
\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}(x,y,z) \frac{dy}{dt}(t) +
\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}(x,y,z) \frac{dz}{dt}(t)$$
