The Chain Rule

If $g$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(x)$, then the composite function $F = f\circ g$ defined by $F(x) = f(g(x))$ is differentiable at $x$ and $F'$ is given by the product
\[
F'(x) = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)
\]
In Leibniz notation, if $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$ are both differentiable functions, then
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = \frac{\diff y}{\diff u} \frac{\diff u}{\diff x}
\]

%I want to cover the proof of the chain rule in my classes. We need to come up with a scheme for including optional material, so we don't need to modify
%the modules themselves (maybe \newcommand{\includeOptionalMaterial}[1]{#1} or something of the sort?).
%\uncover<2->{%
%We will not prove this in class, but a proof can be found in the textbook.
