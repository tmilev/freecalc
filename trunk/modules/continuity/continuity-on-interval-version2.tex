\begin{definition}[Continuous on an Interval]
A function $f$ is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval.

\end{definition}
If $f$ is defined only on one side of an endpoint of the interval, continuous at the endpoint means continuous from the right or continuous from the left. \uncover<2->{\alert<2>{This is a consequence from the definition of continuity. As an exercise, you may try to reason why.}}

\uncover<3->{
Think of a function that is continuous on an interval as a function that has no breaks in its graph, and so can be drawn ``without lifting your pen''.
