\begin{definition}[Continuous on an Interval]
A function $f$ is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval.

(If $f$ is defined only on one side of an endpoint of the interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the right or continuous from the left.)
\end{definition}

\uncover<2->{
Think of a function that is continuous on an interval as a function that has no breaks in its graph.
