\begin{definition}[Continuous on an Interval]
A function $f$ is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval.
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}

\item<2-> If $f$ is defined at the \only<2>{\alert<2>{right}} \only<3->{\alert<3>{left}} endpoint of an interval, continuous means continuous from the \only<2>{\alert<2>{left}} \only<3->{\alert<3>{right}}. 
%\item<4->{\alert<4>{The preceding follows from the definition of continuity. As an exercise, you may try to reason why.}}
\item<4->{
Think of a function that is continuous on an interval as a function that has no breaks in its graph, and so can be drawn ``without lifting your pen''.
}
