\begin{theorem}[Classes of Continuous Functions]
The following types of functions are continuous at every number in their domains:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
polynomials & rational functions \\
root functions & trigonometric functions
\end{tabular}
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Compositions of Continuous Functions]
If $g$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, then the composition function $f\circ g$ given by $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ is continuous at $a$.
