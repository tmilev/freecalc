\begin{definition}[Discontinuous at a Number]
If $f$ is defined near $a$, we say that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$ if $f$ is not continuous at $a$.
\end{definition}

\uncover<2->{
``$f$ is defined near $a$'' means that $f$ is defined on an open interval containing $a$, except perhaps at $a$ itself.

\uncover<3->{
Physical phenomena are usually continuous.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Displacement of a vehicle with respect to time.
\item  Velocity of a vehicle with respect to time.
\item  A person's height with respect to time.
\end{itemize}

Discontinuities sometimes occur when dealing with electric currents.
