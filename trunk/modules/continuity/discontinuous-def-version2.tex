\begin{definition}[Discontinuous at a Number]
Suppose $f$ is defined at $a$. We say $f$ is discontinuous at $a$ if it is not continuous at $a$.
\end{definition}

\uncover<2->{
Physical phenomena are often continuous. The majority of the physical phenomena that are understood are continuous. Examples:
\uncover<3->{
\begin{itemize}
\item Motion of a vehicle with respect to time without sudden brakes.
\item Orbits of planets and celestial bodies with respect to time.
\item A person's height with respect to time.
\item And many more.
\end{itemize}
}
Discontinuous phenomena examples:
\uncover<4->{
\begin{itemize}
\item Particle velocities during collisions and explosions.
\item Electric current phenomena, gating events in porins (the event of a molecule passing in and out of a cell).
\item Particle physics phenomena.
\item And many more.
\end{itemize}
