%The definition of discontinuity requires that f be defined at the point a. Source: wikipedia. Stewart is wrong.
%If $f$ is defined near $a$ <- this is not OK
Suppose $f$ is defined at $a$. We say that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$ if $f$ is not continuous at $a$.
\end{definition}

%this is not OK either:
%\uncover<2->{
%``$f$ is defined near $a$'' means that $f$ is defined on an open interval containing $a$, except perhaps at $a$ itself.

Physical phenomena are usually continuous.

\item  Displacement of a vehicle with respect to time.
\item  Velocity of a vehicle with respect to time.
\item  A person's height with respect to time.
