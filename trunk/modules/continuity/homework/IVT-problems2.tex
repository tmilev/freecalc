\item (1) Solve the equation $x^2+13x+41=1$.  (2) Use the intermediate value theorem to prove that the equation $x^2+13x+41=\sin  x$ has at least two solutions, lying between the two numbers found in (1).
\solution{
\noindent (1)
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^2+13x+41&=&1\\
x^2+13x+40&=&0\\
(x+5)(x+8)&=&0\quad .
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore the two solutions are $x_1=-5$ and $x_2=-8$.

\noindent (2) Consider the function
\[
f(x)=x^2+13x+41-\sin x\quad.
\]
Our strategy for proving $f(x)=0$ has a solution consists in finding a number $a$ such that $f(a)<0$ and a number $b$ such that $f(b)>0$, and then using the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) with $N=0$.

Let
\[
g(x)=x^2+13x+41,
\]
and so $f(x)=g(x)-\sin x$. We have no techniques for evaluating $\sin x$ without calculator, but we do have all knowledge necessary to evaluate $g(x)$. Indeed, from high school we know that the lowest point of the parabola $g(x)$ is located at $x=-\frac{13}2=-6.5$. Then $g(-6.5)= -1.25$. Therefore
\[
f(-6.5)=g(-6.5)-\sin(-6.5)= g(-6.5)+\sin (6.5)=-1.25+\sin 6.5 \leq -0.25,
\]
where for the very last inequality we use the fact that $\sin 6.5< 1 $ (remember $\sin t\leq 1$ for all real values of $t$).

On the other hand,
\[f(-5)= g(-5)-\sin (-5) = 1+\sin 5> 0\]
as $\sin 5 >-1$ (remember $\sin t\geq -1$ for all real values of $t$). Therefore $f(-5)>0$ and $f(-6.5)<0$ and by the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) $f(x)=0$ has a solution in the interval $x\in (-6.5, -5)$.

Proving $f(x)=0$ has a solution in the interval $x\in (-8, -6.5)$ is similar and we leave it to the student.

Below is a computer generated plot of the function with the use of which we can visually verify our answer.
