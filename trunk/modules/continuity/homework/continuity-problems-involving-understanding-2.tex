Show that $f(x)$ is continuous at all irrational points and discontinuous at all rational ones.
\[
f(x)=\doublebrace{\frac{1}{q^2}}{\mathrm{if~}x\mathrm{~is~rational~and~} x=\frac{p}{q} }{0}{\mathrm{if~}x~\mathrm{is~irrational}}
\]
where in the first item $p,q$ are relatively prime integers (i.e., integers without a common divisor).
