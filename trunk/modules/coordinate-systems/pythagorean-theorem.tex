\begin{itemize}
\item A triangle is a right-angled triangle if two of its sides are perpendicular.
\item The two sides perpendicular to one another are called legs. 
\item The two legs form a right angle (90$^{\circ}$).
\item The side opposite to the right angle is called the hypothenuse. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
Let $a,b$ be the lengths of the legs of a right-angled triangle and $c$ the length of its hypotenuse. Then
\[
a^2+b^2=c^2.
\]
\end{theorem}
