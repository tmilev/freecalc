   \item Inclusion - belongs to, is on
   \item Parallelism
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Parallel planes or line parallel to a plane: \\
	      empty intersection
	\item Parallel lines: \\
	      included in a common plane, but empty intersection
	\item Skew lines: \\
	      not included in a common plane
