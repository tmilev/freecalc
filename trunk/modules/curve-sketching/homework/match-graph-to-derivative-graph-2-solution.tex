\solution{\ref{problemMatchGraphToDerivativeGraphProblem2}

(1) matches (c) because (1) has three local extrema and (c) is the only derivative graph with three zeros. 

(2) matches (a) because (2) has one local extrema and (a) is the only derivative graph with one zero. 

(3) matches (e) because (3) has four local extrema ($\pm1$ and $\pm3$) and (e) is the only derivative graph with four zeros. 

(4) matches (b) because (4) has seven local extrema and (b) is the only derivative graph with seven zeros. 

(5) matches (d) because (5) has six local extrema and (d) is the only derivative graph with six zeros.
