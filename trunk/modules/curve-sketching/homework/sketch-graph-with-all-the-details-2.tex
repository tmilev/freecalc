\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the graph of $y = x^4 - 8x^2 + 8$ by determining the intervals of increase and decrease, finding the local mins and maxes, determining where the graph is concave up and concave down, and plotting a few key points.

\answer{
\begin{tabular}{l}
Check your graph with a calculator or online graphing program. \\
Local max at 0, local mins at 2 and -2. Concave down between $-\sqrt{4/3}$ and $\sqrt{4/3}$, and concave up otherwise.
\end{tabular}
}

\item Sketch the graph of $y = \frac{x-1}{x^2-9}$ by graphing any vertical and horizontal asymptotes, finding the $x$- and $y$-intercepts, and then sketching a graph that fits this information.

\answer{
\begin{tabular}{l}
Check your graph with a calculator or online graphing program. \\
Vertical asymptotes at $x = 3$ and $x = -3$. \\ Horizontal
asymptote at $y = 0$. \\
$y$-intercept of $\frac{1}{9}$; $x$-intercept of $1$.
\end{tabular}
}
\end{enumerate}
