\solution{\ref{problemSketchCurve(2x^2-5x+9/2)/(x^2-3 x+3)}
We have that $f$ is not defined only when we have division by zero, i.e.,  if $x^2-3x+3$ equals zero. However, the roots of $x^{2}-3x+3$ are not real numbers: they are $\frac{3\pm \sqrt{3^2-4\cdot 3 }}{2}= \frac{3\pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}$, and therefore $x^2-3x+3$ can never equal zero. Alternatively, completing the square shows that the denominator is always positive:
\[
x^2-3x+3=x^2-2\cdot \frac{3}{2} x+\frac{9}{4}-\frac{9}{4}+3=\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2+\frac{3}{4} >0 
\]
Therefore the domain of $f$ is all real numbers.\textbf{To be continued.}
