\begin{definition}[Inflection Point]
A point $P$ on a curve $y = f(x)$ is called an inflection point if $f$ is continuous at $P$ and the curve changes from concave up to concave down or from concave down to concave up at $P$.
\end{definition}
\uncover<2->{%
Another way of saying this is that $P$ is an inflection point if $f''$ changes signs at $P$.
