\begin{theorem}[The Derivative of $\cos x$]
\[
\frac{\diff}{\diff x} (\cos x ) = -\sin x
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
\item This can be proved in a similar fashion as the formula for $\sin x$.
\item Alternatively, this can be proved using the derivative of $\sin x$ and (the not yet studied) Implicit Differentiation and Chain Rule.
\end{itemize}
