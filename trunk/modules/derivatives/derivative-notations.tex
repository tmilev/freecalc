If $y = f(x)$ is a function, there are many ways to write its derivative.

\[
f'(x) = y' = \frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = \frac{\diff f}{\diff x} = \frac{\diff}{\diff x} f(x) = Df(x) = D_x f(x)
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item  $D$ and $\diff/\diff x$ are called differentiation operators because they indicate the operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating the derivative.

\item  $\diff y/\diff x$ is called Leibniz notation; it means the same as $f'(x)$.  

\item  If we want to indicate the value of the derivative $\diff y/\diff x$ in Leibniz notation at a point $a$, we write
\[
\left. \frac{\diff y}{\diff x}\right|_a \qquad \textrm{or}\qquad \left. \frac{\diff y}{\diff x}\right]_a
\]
\end{itemize}
