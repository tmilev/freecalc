If we use the traditional notation $y = f(x)$ to indicate that the independent variable is $x$ and the dependent variable is $y$, then some common alternative notations for the derivative are as follows:
\[
f'(x) = y' = \frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = \frac{\diff f}{\diff x} = \frac{\diff}{\diff x} f(x) = Df(x) = D_x f(x)
\]
The symbols $D$ and $\diff/\diff x$ are called differentiation operators because they indicate the operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating the derivative.

$\diff y/\diff x$ is called Leibniz notation, and should not be seen as a ratio; it just means the same as $f'(x)$.  

If we want to indicate the value of the derivative $\diff y/\diff x$ in Leibniz notation at a point $a$, we write
\[
\left. \frac{\diff y}{\diff x}\right|_a \qquad \textrm{or}\qquad \left. \frac{\diff y}{\diff x}\right]_a
\]
