The Sum Rule can be extended to any number of summands.  For instance, using the theorem twice, we get
\[
(f+g+h)' = [(f+g)+h]' = (f+g)' + h' = f'+g'+h' .
\]

By writing $f - g$ as $f + (-1)g$ and applying the Sum Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule, we get
\begin{theorem}[The Difference Rule]
If $f$ and $g$ are both differentiable, then
\[
\frac{\diff}{\diff x} [f(x)-g(x)] = \frac{\diff}{\diff x}f(x) - \frac{\diff}{\diff x} g(x).
\]
