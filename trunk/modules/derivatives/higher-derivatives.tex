\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ be a differentiable function.
\item Suppose $f'$ is also differentiable. 
\item Call the derivative of $f'$ by $f''$. Call the derivative of $f''$ by $f'''$ (if it exists) and so on.
\item $f''$ is called second derivative, $f'''$ -third derivative, and so on.
\begin{itemize}
\item $f'$ measures the rate of change of $f$.
\item Therefore $f''$ measures the rate of change of the rate of change of $f$, and so on for the other derivatives.
\item When $f$ measures distance traveled per time, the rate of change of the rate of change is called acceleration (instantaneous change of velocity with respect to time).
