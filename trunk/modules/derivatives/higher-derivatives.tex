\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ be a differentiable function.
\item Suppose $f'$ is also differentiable. 
\item<2-> Call the derivative of $f'$ by $f''$. \uncover<3->{Call the derivative of $f''$ by $f'''$ (if it exists)} \uncover<4->{ and so on.}
\item<5-> $f''$ is called second derivative, $f'''$ -third derivative, and so on.
\begin{itemize}
\item<6-> $f'$ measures the rate of change of $f$.
\item<7-> Therefore $f''$ measures the rate of change of the rate of change of $f$, and so on for the other derivatives.
\begin{itemize}
\item<8-> Suppose $f$ measures distance traveled per unit time.
\item<9-> $f'$ - the rate of change of distance - is called velocity.
\item<10-> $f''$ - the rate of change of velocity -  is called acceleration.
