\solution{\ref{problemDifferentiateFTC1int_x^1(2+t^4)^5dt} %(Contributed by student Anamaria Ronayne)

We recall that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 1 states that $\frac{\diff}{\diff x}\left(\int_{a}^{x}h(t)dt\right)=h(x)$
where $a$ is a constant. We can rewrite the integral so it has $x$ as the upper limit:
\[
f(x)=\int_{x}^{1}(2+1^4)^5dt =-\int_{1}^{x}(2+1^4)^5dt\quad.
\]
Therefore
\[
\frac{\diff}{\diff x}\left( -\int_{1}^{x}(2+t^4)^5 \diff t\right)=- \frac{\diff }{\diff x}\left(\int_{1}^{x}(2+t^4)^5\diff t\right)\stackrel{\text{FTC part 1}}{=}
-(2+x^4)^5\quad .
\]
