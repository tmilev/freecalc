\frametitle{(10.1) Modeling with Differential Equations}
\begin{itemize}
\item  When modeling real-world problems, we often have a relationship between an unknown function and some of its derivatives.  
\item  Such a relationship is called a differential equation.
\item  It is not always possible to find an explicit solution to a differential equation, but sometimes a graphical or approximate answer can be good enough for applications.
\end{itemize}
