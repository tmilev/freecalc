\begin{itemize}
\item  Often we don't want to find all solutions (the general solution).
\item  Instead, we only want to find a single solution that satisfies some additional requirement.
\item  Often that requirement has the form $y(t_0) = y_0$.
\item  This is called an \textbf{initial condition}, or \textbf{initial value}.
\item  This type of problem is called an \textbf{initial value problem (IVP)}.
