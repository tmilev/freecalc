\frametitle{Models of Population Growth}
\begin{itemize}
\item  One model for population growth assumes that the population grows at a rate proportional to its size.
\item  In other words, if a certain number of bacteria produce a certain number of offspring in a certain time, then ten times that many bacteria produce ten times that many offspring in the same time.
\item  This is plausible when the population has unlimited food and environment and no restrictions on its size.
\item<2->  Name the variables:
\uncover<2->{%
\begin{quote}
$t = $ time %(the independent variable)

$P = $ the number of individuals in the population %(the dependent variable)
\end{quote}
}%
\item<3->  The rate of growth is $\diff P/\diff t$.
\item<4->  Then ``rate of growth proportional to population size'' means
\end{itemize}
\uncover<4->{%
\[
\frac{\diff P}{\diff t} = k P
\]
where $k$ is the proportionality constant.
