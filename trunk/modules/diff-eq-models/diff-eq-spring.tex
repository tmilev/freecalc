\frametitle{A Model for the Motion of a Spring}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Suppose we have an object with mass $m$ attached to a spring.
\item  Hooke's Law: if the spring is stretched or compressed $x$ units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to $x$.
\item  Force equals mass times acceleration.
\item  Acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time.
\[
m\frac{\diff^2 x}{\diff t^2} = -kx
\]
\item<2->  This is called a second-order differential equation because it involves second derivatives.
\item<3->  Sine and cosine functions are solutions.
\end{itemize}
