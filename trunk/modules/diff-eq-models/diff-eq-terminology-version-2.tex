\begin{definition} 
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
A \textbf{differential equation} is an equation that contains an unknown function and some of its derivatives.


\item<2->
The \textbf{order} of a differential equation is the highest derivative that appears in it.


\item<3->
A function $f$ is called a \textbf{solution} of a differential equation if the equation is satisfied when $f$ and its derivatives are plugged in.


\item<4->
When we are asked to \textbf{solve} a differential equation we are expected to find all possible solutions.
