\frametitle{The Logistic Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The Logistic Model works in cases when the population is constrained by its environment.
\item  Let $P(t)$ be the population at time $t$.
\item  Then the Logistic Equation is:
\end{itemize}
\[
\frac{\diff P}{\diff t} = kP\left( 1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item  The constant $K$ is called the carrying capacity.  It represents how many individuals the environment can sustain in the long run.
\end{itemize}
