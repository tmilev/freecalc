\frametitle{The Law of Natural Growth}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Recall that differential equations could be used to model population growth.
\item  The Law of Natural Growth works in ideal cases, where populations are unconstrained by lack of food, or the environment.
\item  Let $P(t)$ be the population at time $t$.
\item  Then the Law of Natural Growth says:
\end{itemize}
\[
\frac{\diff P}{\diff t} = kP
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item  The constant $k$ is sometimes called the relative growth rate.
\end{itemize}
