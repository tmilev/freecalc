\frametitle{Separable Equations}
In this section, we will discuss a type of differential equation, called a separable equation, for which it is possible to find an explicit solution.

\begin{definition}[Separable Equation]
A separable equation is a first-order equation in which the expression for $\diff y/\diff x$ can be factored as a function of $x$ times a function of $y$.  In other words,
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = g(x)f(y).
\]
\end{definition}

\uncover<2->{%
Let $f(y) = 1/h(y)$.  Then
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = \frac{g(x)}{h(y)}.
\]
