\solution{\ref{problemDFQseparable-mixing-problem-1}. Let 
\[
y(t)=\text{salt in the tank after } t \text{ minutes (in kg)}\quad .
\] 
We are given $y(0)= 30$kg, the initial amount of salt. We are looking to find $y(45)$, the amount of salt after $45$ minutes. We have that 
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff t}= \text{(rate in)} - \text{(rate~out)} \quad .
\]
The rate of salt entering the tank is constant: 
\[
\text{(rate in)}=0.05 kg/L \cdot 10 L/min= 0.5 kg/min\quad .
\] 
As the solution is thoroughly mixed, at any time the concentration of salt in the tank is 
\[
\displaystyle \frac{y}{ 10000} kg/L.
\] 
Therefore the rate of salt going out of the tank is 
\[
\text{(rate out)}=\frac{y}{10000} kg/L * 10 L/min = \frac{y}{1000} kg/min\quad .
\] 
Therefore the differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank is
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff t}= \underbrace{ 0.5}_{\text{(rate  in)}}- \underbrace{ \frac{y}{1000} }_{\text{(rate out)}}\quad .
\]
To find $y(45)$, we integrate from $t=0$ to $t=45$:
\[
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{rcll|l}
\displaystyle \int\limits_{t=0}^{45} \frac{1000}{500- y} \underbrace{ \frac{\diff y}{\diff t} \diff t}_{\diff (y(t))} &=& \displaystyle \int\limits_{t=0}^{45} \diff t \\
\displaystyle \int\limits_{t=0}^{t=45} \frac{1000}{500-y(t)}\diff (y(t))&=& 45&&\text{set }z=y(t) \\
\displaystyle -1000 \int \limits_{z=y(0)=30}^{z=y(45)} \frac{1}{500-z}d(500-z)&=& 45 \\
\displaystyle \left. -1000 \ln |500-y| \right]_{y(0)=30}^{y(45)}&=& 45 \\
\displaystyle -1000 \left( \ln |500-y(45)|\right. \\
\left. -\ln |500- 30|  \right) &=& 45 \\
\displaystyle \ln \left| \frac{470}{500-y(45)} \right|  &=& \displaystyle \frac{45}{1000}
\\
\displaystyle \ln \left( \frac{470}{500-y(45)} \right)  &=& \displaystyle \frac{45}{1000} &&\text{see below}
\\
\displaystyle \frac{470}{500-y(30)}&=&\displaystyle e^{\frac{45}{1000}}\\
\displaystyle 500-y(30)&=&\displaystyle  470e^{-\frac{9}{200}}\\
\displaystyle y(30)&=&\displaystyle 500-470e^{-\frac{9}{200}}\\
&\approx& 500-470\cdot 0.955997 \\
&\approx& 50.681184 \quad ,
\end{array}
}
\]
where we have used that $\displaystyle \frac{470}{500-y(t)}>0 $. The fact that $\displaystyle \frac{470}{500-y(t)}>0 $ can be seen as follows. As $500-y(0)=470>0$ and $y(t)$ is continuous, in order to have $500-y(t)<0$ there must exist some $x_1$ for which $y(x_1)=500$. However this is impossible since $\displaystyle x=\ln \left|\frac{470}{500-y(x)}\right|  $. 

As the unit of measurement is $kg$, the final answer to the problem is $\approx 50.68 kg$ salt.
