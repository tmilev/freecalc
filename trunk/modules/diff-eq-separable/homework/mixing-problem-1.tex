\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{problemMixingProblem1}
A tank contains 30 kg of salt dissolved in water to form $10000$ liters of solution. Brine that contains $0.05$ kg of salt per liter enters the tank at a rate of 10 liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate (10 liters per minute). Determine how much salt remains in the tank after half an hour.
\item \label{problemMixingProblem2} A tank contains $1000$ kg of salt dissolved in water to form $10000$ liters of solution. Brine that contains $0.01$ kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of $30$ liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate ($30$ liters per minute). 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Determine how much salt remains in the tank after an hour. 
\item How long should the procedure continue  so that the solution in the tank gets to a salt concentration of $0.101$ kg/L?
