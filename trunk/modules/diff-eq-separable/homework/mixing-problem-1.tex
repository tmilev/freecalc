A tank contains 1000 kg of salt dissolved in 10000 liters of water. Brine that contains 0.05 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 30 liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate (30 liters per minute). Determine how much salt remains in the tank after an hour. Again, feel free to look up the sample problem from the notes.
