A tank contains $30$ kg of salt dissolved in $10000$ liters of water and salt solution. Brine that contains $0.05$ kg of salt per liter enters the tank at a rate of $10$ liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate ($10$ liters per minute). Determine how much salt remains in the tank after $45$ minutes.

\answer{$\displaystyle 500-470 e^{-\frac{9}{200}} \approx 50.68 kg$}
\item A tank contains $1000$ kg of salt dissolved in 10000 liters of water. Brine that contains $0.05$ kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of $30$ liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate ($30$ liters per minute). 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine how much salt remains in the tank after an hour. The answer key has not been proofread, use with caution.

\answer{$\displaystyle 500+ 500 e^{-0.18}\approx 917.64kg$}
\item Determine how much time will be needed in order to have the concentration of salt in the tank reach $0.0501$kg/liter. The answer key has not been proofread, use with caution.

\answer{$\frac{1000}{3}\ln 500\approx 2071.54min\approx 34.53 hours$}
