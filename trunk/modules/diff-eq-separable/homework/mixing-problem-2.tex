Mixing problem. A tank contains $1000$ kg of salt dissolved in 10000 liters of water. Brine that contains $0.05$ kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of $30$ liters per minute. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate ($30$ liters per minute). 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine how much salt remains in the tank after an hour.
\item Determine how much time will be needed in order to have the concentration of salt in the tank reach $0.0501$kg/liter.
\end{enumerate}
