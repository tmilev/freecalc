\frametitle{Mixing Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Typical mixing problems involve:
\item  A tank of fixed capacity.
\item  A completely mixed solution of some substance in the tank.
\item  A solution of a certain concentration enters the tank at a fixed rate.
\item  In the tank, the solution immediately becomes completely stirred.
\item  The mixture leaves at the other end at a fixed rate (possibly a different rate).
\item<2->  Let $y(t)$ denote the amount of substance in the tank at time $t$.
\item<2->  Then $y'(t)$ denotes the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being removed.
\item<2->  This often gives a differential equation.
