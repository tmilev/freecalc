\begin{itemize}
\item We defined $\int f(x) dx$ as an anti-derivative of $f(x)$ and $\int_{a} ^b f(x)dx $ as the definite integral of $f$.
\item The $\int$ sign stands for the limit of a Riemann sum (sum of approximating rectangles).
\item $dx$ stands for the base of an ``infinitesimally small'' approximating rectangle, $f(x)$ stands for the height.
\item ``Infinitesimally small'' is an informal expression. 
\item The strict mathematical terminology for the expression $f(x) dx$
is differential form.
\item Differential forms were not defined as stand-alone objects in Calc I (can't be used without integrals).
\item Differentials can be defined on their own, and integrals can be defined as functions on the differential forms. 
\end{itemize}
