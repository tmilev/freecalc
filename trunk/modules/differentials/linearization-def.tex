\begin{definition}[Linearization of $f$ at $a$]
The linear function whose graph is the tangent line at $(a,f(a))$ is called the linearization of $f$ at $a$.  Its equation is
\[
L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a).
\]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Linear Approximation of $f$ at $a$]
The approximation
\[
f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
\]
is called the linear approximation of $f$ at $a$.
