\begin{question}
Can we plot the graph of an arbitrary equation?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> For sufficiently well behaved equations the answer is yes.
%\item We illustrate one computer algorithm for doing this.
\item<4-> The theory behind plotting arbitrary equations, even when they are well behaved, is well beyond the scope of the present course. 
\item<5-> In particular, while computer algorithms plot graphs of well-behaved equations relatively well, it is not clear why those algorithms work.
\end{itemize}
