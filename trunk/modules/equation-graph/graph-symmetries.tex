\item A graph is symmetric with respect to the $x$ axis for each $(x,y)$ lying on the graph $(x,-y)$ also lies on the graph.
\item A graph is symmetric with respect to the $y$ axis for each $(x,y)$ lying on the graph $(-x,y)$ also lies on the graph.
\item A graph is symmetric with respect to the origin if for each $(x,y)$ lying on the graph $(-x,-y)$ also lies on the graph.
