In general, if $y (t)$ is the value of a quantity at time $t$ and if the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $t$ is proportional to its size, then\\
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff t} = ky
\]
where $k$ is a constant.\\ \pause 
 This  is sometimes called the {\bf{law of natural growth}}
 (if $k > 0$) or the {\bf{law of natural decay}} (if $k < 0$). \\ \pause 
 It is called a \textbf{differential equation} because it  involves an unknown function and its derivative.\\
 \pause 
 Note that if $ y=Ce^{kt} $ then $ y(0)=Ce^0=C$, so $ C $ is the initial value of the function.

\begin{theorem}
The only solutions to the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dt}=ky $ are $ y=Ce^{kt}$, where $C=y(0)( = y_0)$. 
\end{theorem}
