\frametitle{A Note on Domains of Functions}
If the domain of a function isn't specified, it is implied to be all numbers $x$ for which the formula $f(x)$ is defined. There are some restrictions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2->  Can't divide by $0$.
\item<3->  Even roots of a negative number are not defined in this course ($\sqrt{-1} , \sqrt[4]{-2053}, \sqrt[6]{-15} \ldots$ not allowed).
\item<4->  Taking $\log x$ if $x \leq 0$ is not allowed in this course; taking  $\log 0$ is not allowed in any course.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
