\begin{itemize}
\item The notation $f(x)$ for the image of $x$ was introduced by Leonhard Euler.
\item<2-> Expressions such as $a(x+y)$ may either refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item<3-> the function $a$ applied to the argument $x+y$ or
\item<4-> the number $a$ multiplied by $x+y$.
\end{itemize}
\item<5-> Which of the two cases is at hand should be clarified with English language. 
\item<6-> However if no such clarification is present (as often is the case in mathematical exercises/tests), the matter is up to the reader's intelligent interpretation.
