\solution{\ref{problemConvergencex^2/(x^4+2)from-inftyto+infty}
The integrand is a rational function and therefore we can solve this problem by finding the indefinite integral and then computing the limit. We would need to start by factoring $x^4+2$ into irreducible quadratic factors - that is already quite laborious:
\[
x^4+2= \left(x^2+\sqrt[4]{8}x+\sqrt{2} \right)\left(x^2-\sqrt[4]{8}x+\sqrt{2}\right)\quad.
\]
The problem asks us only to establish the convergence of the integral; it does not ask us to compute its actual numerical value. Therefore we can give a much simpler solution. The function is even and therefore it suffices to establish whether $\displaystyle \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x$ is convergent.

We have that 
\[
\int\limits_{0}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x= \int\limits_{0}^1 \frac{x^2}{ x^4 +2 }\diff x+\int\limits_{1}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x\quad.
\]
The function $ \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}$ is continuous so $\int\limits_{0}^1 \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x$ integrates to a number, which does not affect the convergence of the above expression. Therefore the convergence of our integral is governed by the convergence of $\int\limits_{1}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x$. To establish that that integral is convergent, we use the comparison theorem as follows.
\[
\begin{array}{rcll|l}
\displaystyle
\int\limits_{1}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\diff x&\leq & \displaystyle \int \limits_{ 1}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4}\diff x && \begin{array}{l} \text{we have that } x^4+2>x^4\\ \text{and therefore }\displaystyle \frac{x^2}{x^4+2}\leq \frac{x^2}{x^4}\end{array}\\
&=&\displaystyle \int_1^{\infty} x^{-2}\diff x\\
&=&\displaystyle \lim\limits_{t\to \infty} \left[ -\frac{1}{x}\right]_{1}^{t}\\
&=&\displaystyle  \lim\limits_{t\to\infty} 1- \frac{1}{t}\\
&=&\displaystyle  1\quad .
\end{array}
\]
In this way we showed $ \displaystyle\int_{1}^\infty \frac{x^2}{x^4+2} \diff x \leq 1$. Therefore, as $\displaystyle \frac{x^2 }{ x^4 + 2}\geq 0 $ is positive, we can apply the comparison theorem to get that $\displaystyle\int_{1}^\infty \frac{ x^2}{x^4+2} \diff x $ is convergent.
