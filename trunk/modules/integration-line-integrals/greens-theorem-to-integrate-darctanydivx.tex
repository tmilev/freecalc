  We proved that the radial irrotational and incompressible fields are of the form
%
$$\fcv{X} = ar^{-1} \; \fcv{e}_r\; .$$
%
Let $C$ be a closed curve enclosing the domain $D$. If $D$ does not contain the origin, then we can use Green's theorem to conclude that
%
$$\oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff r} = \int_D \curl_{\bm{k}} \fcv{X} \, dA = 0$$
%
and
%
$$\oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s} = \int_D \divg \fcv{X} \, dA = 0$$

But if $D$ contains the origin, then we can't use Green's theorem \emph{like above}, because $\fcv{X}$ is not defined everywhere in $D$! But we can still use Green's theorem to reduce the computations to more manageable curves!

Let $C_R$ be a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin and contained in $D$, and let $E$ be the region between the circle $C_R$ and the curve $C$. We can now use Green's theorem on $E$, because $X$ is defined everywhere on $E$. However, extra caution is needed for the line integral on $C_R$, because the exterior from $E$ normal to $C_R$ orients the curve \emph{clockwise}! Therefore we get
%
$$\oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s} - \oint_{C_R} \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s} = \int_E \divg \fcv{X} \, dA = 0 \Longrightarrow \oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s} = \oint_{C_R} \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s}\;.$$
%
The last integral is easy to compute because $\fcv{X}$ is a constant multiple of a unit normal:
%
$$\oint_{C_R} \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff s} = \int_{C_R} aR^{-1} \diff s = \int_{0}^{2\pi} aR^{-1} \, R \, \diff s = 2\pi a \; .$$
%
Therefore the flux across any curve that encloses the origin is $2\pi a$.

Similarly
%
%
$$\oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff r} - \oint_{C_R} \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff r} = \int_E \curl_{\bm{k}} \fcv{X} \, dA = 0 \Longrightarrow \oint_C \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff r} = \oint_{C_R} \fcv{X} \cdot \fcv{\diff r} = 0\;,$$
%
because $\fcv{X}$ is normal to $C_R$. Hence the circulation along any curve is still 0, which is not really that surprising given that any field of the form $f(r)\fcv{e}_r$ is a gradient field.
