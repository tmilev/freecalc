Let $D$ be a set in the plane whose boundary $C=\partial D$ is a piecewise smooth oriented curve. Suppose $P$ and $Q$ functions in the plane that have continuous partial derivatives in an open region around $D$.
\begin{theorem}[Green]
\[\oint_C P \diff x + Q \diff y = \iint_D \left( \frac{ \partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{ \partial P}{ \partial y} \right) \diff x \diff y \; .
\]
\end{theorem}

Companion formula:
\[
\oint_C P\diff y - Q\diff x = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial P}{ \partial x} + \frac{ \partial Q}{\partial y} \right) \diff x \diff y \; .
