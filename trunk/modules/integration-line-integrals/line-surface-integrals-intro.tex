\frametitle{Overview of Integrals Covered so Far}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have so far studied integrals over:
\begin{itemize}
\item intervals on a line;
\item planar regions in the plane;
\item solid regions in space.
\end{itemize}
\item<2-> All studied integrals were over regions that have the same dimension as their ambient space.
\item<3-> Can we make sense of an integral over region that has lower dimension then the ambient space?
\item<4-> We can for arbitrary $k$-dimensional surface in $n$ dimensional space. We will only consider the examples of
\begin{itemize}
\item a curve (1D region) embedded in a plane (2D)
\item a curve (1D region) embedded in space (3D)
\item a surface (2D region) embedded in space (3D).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
