Compute the triple integral. The integrals are set up to be easy in cylindrical coordinates.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\iiint_{\mathcal S} \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\diff x\diff y \diff z$, where $\mathcal S$ is the solid conical body with vertical axis along the z axis, pointing upwards, of height $1$ and with circular base of radius 1 lying on the $xy$-plane.
\end{enumerate}
