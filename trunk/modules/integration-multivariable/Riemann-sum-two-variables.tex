Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a compact (closed, bounded) region in the plane, and let $f \colon \mathcal{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function on $\mathcal{R}$.
\uncover<2->{Let $\{D_k\}$ be finite set of regions covering $\mathcal{R}$} with the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $D_k$ is a compact set.
\item The boundary of each $D_k$ is a collection of smooth curves.
\item Two regions $D_i$ and $D_j$ may overlap only on their boundaries.
\end{itemize}
Let $\mathcal{P} = (P_k)_k$ be a collection of sample points, with $P_k \in D_k$ for all $k$.

\begin{definition}[Riemann sum]
The \emph{Riemann sum} defined by such data is
$
%\Sigma_{f,\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}} = 
\displaystyle\sum\limits_k f(P_k) \; \text{area}(D_k)\; .
