$\mathcal R$-region covered by $D_k$, $D_k$ don't overlap except at boundaries.
\begin{definition}[Riemann sum]
The \emph{Riemann sum} defined by such data is
$
%\Sigma_{f,\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}} = 
\displaystyle\sum\limits_k f(P_k) \; \text{area}(D_k)\; .
$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}

If the limit
\[
\lim\limits_{\max_k(\text{diam} D_k) \to 0} \sum_k f(P_k) \; \text{area}(D_k)
\]
exists and is finite, then its value is called the \emph{double integral of $f$ over $\mathcal{R}$ (with respect to area)}, and is denoted by
\[
\iint_{\mathcal{R}} f(P) \diff A\quad  .
\]
\end{definition}
