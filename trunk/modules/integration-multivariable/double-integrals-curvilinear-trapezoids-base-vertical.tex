\begin{itemize}
  \item \pause Identify the leftmost point, $(a,*)$, and the rightmost point, $(b,*)$.
  \item \pause Draw a generic vertical slice at some value $x$ between $a$ and $b$.
  \item \pause Find the lowest point on that slice, $(x,g_1(x))$ and the highest point, $(x,g_2(x))$.
\end{itemize}
\pause
The region is the region bounded by:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \pause vertical lines $\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{x=a}$ and $\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{x=b}$;
   \item \pause the graphs of $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y=g_1(x)}$ and $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y=g_2(x)}$, with $g_1,g_2 \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$:
