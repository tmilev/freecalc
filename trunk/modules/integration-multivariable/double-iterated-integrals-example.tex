Use iterated integrals to compute the following integral:
%
$$\int\!\!\!\int_{[1,2]\times [2,3]}\!\!\!\!\!\! (2x+3y^2) \; dxdy$$
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pause For $(x,y)$ in $[1,2]\times [2,3]$, $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y}$ takes values \pause between $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{c=2}$ and $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{d=3}$.
  \item \pause For a fixed value $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y=y_0}$, $\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{x}$ takes values \pause between $\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{a=1}$ and $\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{b=2}$.
\end{itemize}
\pause
Then the double integral can be set up as the following iterated integral:
%
$$\int\!\!\!\int_{[1,2]\times [2,3]}\!\!\!\!\!\! (2x+3y^2) \; dxdy = \int_{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y=2}}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{y=3}} \left( \int_{\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{x=1}}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{x=2}} (2x+3y^2) \; \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{dx} \right) \; \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{dy} $$
\pause
Integral with respect to $x$ \pause $\Longrightarrow$ $y$ is a constant:
%
$$g(y) = \int_{x=1}^{x=2} (2x+3y^2) \; dx = \left. (x^2+3y^2x) \right|_{x=1}^{x=2} = (4+6y^2)-(1+3y^2) = 3+3y^2\; .$$
%
\pause Continuing the computation we get\pause
%
$$\int\!\!\!\int_{[1,2]\times [2,3]}\!\!\!\!\!\! (2x+3y^2) \; dxdy = \int_{y=2}^{y=3} (3+3y^2)\; dy = \left. (3y+y^3) \right|_{y=2}^{y=3} = 36-14=22\; .$$
