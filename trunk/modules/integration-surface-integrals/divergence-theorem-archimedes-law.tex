A solid body is submerged into a tank containing a liquid of constant density $\rho$. What is the buoyant force?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \pause Body occupies a region $D$, exterior boundary $S$;
  \item Unit outward normal field $\fcv{N}$;
  \item \pause Magnitude of pressure at depth $a$ below the surface is $p_0+\rho a g$, where
   \begin{itemize}
     \item $g$ is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration.
     \item $p_0$ is the pressure at surface of liquid
   \end{itemize}
  \item \pause Infinitesimal force acting on $S$ is $\diff \fcv{F} = -(p_0+\rho a g) \, \fcv{N} \, \diff S$,
  \item  \pause The total force is
%
$$\bm{F} = \iint_S \, \diff \fcv{F} = \iint_S -(p_0+\rho a g) \, \fcv{N} \, \diff S = \iint_S -\rho a g \, \bm{N}\,\diff S = \iint_S \rho g z \, \bm{N}\,\diff S$$
%
\item \pause EC: Use the Divergence Theorem to show that $\fcv{F} = \rho V g \, \fcv{k}$

    ($V$: volume of the region enclosed by $S$.)

\end{itemize}
