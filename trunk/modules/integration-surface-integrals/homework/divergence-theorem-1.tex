Use the divergence theorem to compute the flux of $\fcv F$ through the surface $\mathcal S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\fcv F=\fcv k$, $\mathcal S$ is the hemisphere, oriented upwards, with radius $1$, whose axis is the $z$-axis and whose base lies in the $x,y$-plane.
\item $\fcv F=(x^2+y^2) \fcv k$, where $\mathcal S$ is the part of the paraboloid with equation $z=1-x^2-y^2$ that lies above the $x,y$-plane. $\mathcal S$ is oriented upwards.
\end{enumerate}
