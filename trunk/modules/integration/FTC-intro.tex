\frametitle{The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus has two parts.
\item<2->  Part 2 of the FTC roughly says ``integration undoes differentiation.''
\item<3->  Part 2 of the FTC was already studied as the Evaluation Theorem. It allows us to compute integrals by finding antiderivatives, without writing limits of Riemann sums.

\item<4->  Part 1 of the FTC roughly says ``differentiation undoes integration.''
\item<5->  Part 1 of the FTC deals with functions of the form
\[
\uncover<2->{%
g(x) = \int_a^x  f(t) \diff t%
}%
\]
\uncover<2->{where $f$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $x$ varies between $a$ and $b$.}
