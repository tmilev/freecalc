\frametitle{(5.3) The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a connection between differential calculus and integral calculus.
\item  It allows us to compute integrals very easily, without finding limits of Riemann sums.
\item  It has two different parts.
\item  Part 1 says, roughly, that ``differentiation undoes integration.''
\item  Part 2 says, roughly, that ``integration undoes differentiation.''
\item<2->  Part 1 deals with functions of the form
\[
\uncover<2->{%
g(x) = \int_a^x  f(t) \diff t%
}%
\]
\uncover<2->{where $f$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $x$ varies between $a$ and $b$.}
