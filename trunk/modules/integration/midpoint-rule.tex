\frametitle{The Midpoint Rule}
\begin{itemize}
\item  We've learned that any sample point $x_i^*$ in $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ will work.
\item  However, choosing $x_i^*$ to be the midpoint of the interval often gives the best approximation.
\item  This midpoint is denoted by $\overline{x}_i$.
\end{itemize}
The Midpoint Rule says
\[
\int_a^b f(x)\diff x \approx \sum_{i=1}^n f(\overline{x}_i)\Delta x
\]
where
\[
\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}
\]
and
\[
\overline{x}_i=\frac{1}{2}(x_{i-1}+x_i).
\]
