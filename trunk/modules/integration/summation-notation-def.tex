\begin{definition}
 {\bf Sigma Notation:} The sum of $n$ terms $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ is written as
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n
\]                                     
where $i$ is 	the {\it index of summation}, $a_i$ is the {\it{$i$'th term}}, and the 
{\it{upper and lower bounds of summation}} are $n$ and $1$ respectively.
\end{definition}
NOTE:  The lower bound doesn't have to be 1. 
 Any integer less than or equal to the upper bound is legitimate.\\
The index $i$ may be replaced with another symbol, often $j$ or $k$.\\

\[
\sum_{j=3}^7 j^2= \fcAnswerUncover{2}{3}{9}+  \fcAnswerUncover{2}{5}{16}+\fcAnswerUncover{2}{7}{25+36+49} 
\]
