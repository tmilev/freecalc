Recall that every function which can be using the four arithmetic operations ($+,-,*,/$) and radicals $\sqrt[n]{~}$ is an algebraic function.  
\begin{theorem}[Direct Substitution]
Let $f$ be an algebraic function. Let the point $a$ be in its domain (i.e., $f(a)$ is defined). Then $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)$.
\end{theorem}
\pause
This theorem is a partial case of the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Can be taken as definition]
Let $f$ be a \alert<3>{continuous function}. Let the point $a$ be in its domain (i.e., $f(a)$ is defined). Then $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)$.
\end{theorem}
\pause
\alert<3>{Continuous functions} will be defined later in this lecture.
