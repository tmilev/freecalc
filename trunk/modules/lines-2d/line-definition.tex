\begin{definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item An equation of the form $ax+by+c=0$, where $a,b,c$ are constants such that $a$ and $b$ are not simultaneously zero, is called a linear equation
\item<2->\alertNoH{0}{A set of pairs of numbers $(x,y)$ is called a line in $\mathbb R^2$ if it is the set of solutions to some linear equation.}
\item<3->  \alertNoH{6}{\only<handout:0|7->{\color{gray!30}} A set of points in the plane will be called a line if it is the graph of some linear equation.}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
\item<4-> To introduce the Cartesian coordinate system we used informal, intuitive notions of point, lines and the plane.
\item<5-> We could (and often do in more advanced subjects) remove this informality by \emph{defining} $\mathbb R^2$ to be the Euclidean plane.
