$1$ day after the start of hypothetical experiment a population of fruit flies was measured to have $110$ individuals. $3$ days after the start there were $190$ flies. Write down an exponential growth law that fits this data. According to the model, how may fruit were there at the start of the experiment? After $5$ days? The answer key has not been proofread, use with caution.

\answer{$P(t)=be^{at}$  $a=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{19}{11}\right)\approx 0.273$, $b=110e^{-a}\approx 84$, $P(0)=b\approx 84$, $P(5)\approx 328$}
