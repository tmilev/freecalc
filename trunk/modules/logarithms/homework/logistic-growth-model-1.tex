In a hypothetical experiment, the number of E. Coli bacteria cells is modeled with a logistic curve $\displaystyle E(t)= \frac{2.8\times 10^{11}}{1+ (3.5\times 10^9) e^{-1.2t }} $, where $t$ measures time in hours since the start of the experiment. 
\begin{itemize}
\item According to the model, approximately how many cells were there at the start of the experiment?
\item According to the model, how many hours are needed for the number of cells to be approximately $10^{10}$?
\end{itemize}
The answer key has not been proofread, use with caution.

\answer{about $80$ cells at the start; about $15.6$ hours needed for $10^{10}$ cells.}
