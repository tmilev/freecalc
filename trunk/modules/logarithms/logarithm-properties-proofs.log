! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.

I'm ignoring this, since I wasn't doing a \csname.

look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

l.2 \begin
          {example}
Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
<recently read> }
                 
l.2 \begin
          {example}
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

! You can't use `\hrule' here except with leaders.
\frame ...h #1\vrule \@width \@wholewidth }\hrule 
                                                  \@height \@wholewidth \vsk...
l.2 \begin
          {example}
To put a horizontal rule in an hbox or an alignment,
you should use \leaders or \hrulefill (see The TeXbook).

my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
