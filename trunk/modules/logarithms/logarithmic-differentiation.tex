Steps in Logarithmic Differentiation
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Take natural logarithms of both sides of an equation $y = f(x)$.
\item  Use the properties of logarithms to simplify.
\item  Differentiate implicitly with respect to $x$.
\item  Solve the resulting equation for $y'$.
\end{enumerate}
Note: If $f(x) < 0$, then we use $\ln |f(x)|$ instead as $\ln (f(x))$ is not defined. We computed the derivative of $\ln |f(x)|$ in the previous lecture.
