We recall from previous slides that
\[
\frac{\diff}{\diff x} (\ln |x|) = \frac{1}{x}.
\]
This formula has a special application to integration:
\begin{theorem}[The Integral of $1/x$]
\[
\int \frac{1}{x} \diff x = \ln |x| + C.
\]
\end{theorem}
\uncover<2->{
This fills in the gap in the rule for integrating power functions:
\[
\int x^n \diff x = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \qquad n \neq -1.
\]
Now we know the formula for $n = -1$ too.
