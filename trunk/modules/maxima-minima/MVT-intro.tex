\frametitle{The Mean Value Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first derivative test, the results on concavity and curve sketching, as well as the (soon to be covered) topics of linear approximation and integration depend on an important theorem.
\item This is the Mean Value Theorem.
\item We will give a complete proof of the Mean Value Theorem.
\item We start with a prerequisite result called Rolle's Theorem.
\end{itemize}
