\frametitle{The Closed Interval Method}

We know from the Extreme Value Theorem that a continuous function attains its absolute maximum and minimum on a closed interval $[a,b]$.  The maximum might be a local maximum, or it might occur at an endpoint.  The minimum might be a local minimum, or it might occur at an endpoint.

\uncover<2->{%
To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function $f$ on a closed interval $[a,b]$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find the values of $f$ at the critical numbers of $f$ in $[a,b]$.
\item  Find the values of $f$ at the endpoints $a$ and $b$.
\item  The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute minimum value.
\end{enumerate}
