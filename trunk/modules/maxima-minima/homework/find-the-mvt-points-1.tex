Recall that given a function $f$ satisfying certain conditions, the Mean value Theorem relates the slope of a secant line of the graph of $f$ to the slope of a tangent line to $f$ at some intermediate point(s) $c$.

Give the precise statement of the Mean Value Theorem. 

For the given functions and the given intervals, find the point(s) $c$ that satisfies the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem.

\begin{itemize}
\item $\displaystyle f(x)=x^2$, for the interval $[1,3]$.

\answer{$c=2$}
\item $\displaystyle f(x)=x^3-6x^2+11x-6$, for the interval $[1,3]$.

\answer{$c=2+\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3}, 2-\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3}$}
\item $\displaystyle f(x)=\ln x$, for the interval $[1,e]$.

\answer{$c= e-1 $}
\item $\displaystyle f(x)=\cos x$, for the interval $[0,\pi]$.

\answer{$c=\frac{\pi}{2} $}
\end{itemize}
