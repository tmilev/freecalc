\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the dimensions of a rectangle with area 1000 $m^2$ whose perimeter is as small as possible.
\item A box with an open top is to be constructed from a square piece of cardboard, 1m wide, by cutting out a square from each of the four corners and bending up the sides. Find the largest volume that such a box can have.
\item A right circular cylinder is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. Find the largest possible volume of such a cylinder.
\item A wedge of radius $2$ (depicted below) is folded into a cone cup. The volume varies depending on the angle of the wedge. Find the maximal possible volume of the cone cup and the angle of the wedge for which this maximal volume is achieved.
