\item We have that $f$ is continuous in $[0,10]$ and differentiable in $(0,10)$. If $f(0)=0$, $f(10)=10$ and $|f'(x)|\leq 1$, how large can $f(x)$ be for $x$ in the interval $[0,10]$?

\answer{ $ 10 $}
\item We have that $f$ is continuous in $[0,10]$ and differentiable in $(0,10)$. If $f(0)=-3$, $f(2)=-13$ and $|f'(x)|\leq 5$, what is the smallest possible value of $f(1)$?

\answer{ $ -8 $}
