\frametitle{(4.1) Maximum and Minimum Values}
Many real-world problems involve optimization (finding the best possible way of doing something).  Examples include
\begin{itemize}
\item  What shape of can minimizes manufacturing costs?
\item  What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle?
\item  What is the maximum load an elevator can carry?
\item  What shape of car minimizes wind resistance?
\end{itemize}
Questions like these can be reduced to finding maximum or minimum values of a function.
