\frametitle{Maximum and Minimum Values}
Many real-world problems involve finding minima and maxima (finding minimal costs, maximal profit, shortest time to do a job, etc.).  Examples include
\begin{itemize}
\item  What shape of can minimizes manufacturing costs?
\item  What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle?
\item  What is the maximum load an elevator can carry?
%\item  What shape of car minimizes wind resistance?
%This example is way out of line. 
\end{itemize}
Often such questions can be reduced to finding maximum or minimum values of a function. In Calculus I, we study how to minimize and maximize functions in one variable.
