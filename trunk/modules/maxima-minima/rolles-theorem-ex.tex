\begin{example}
Prove that the function $f(x) = x^3 + 4x - 4$ has exactly one real root.
\begin{itemize}
\item<2->  First show that it has a real root:
\item<2-| alert@3-4>  $f(0) =$ \uncover<4->{$-4$.}
\item<2-| alert@5-6>  $f(1) =$ \uncover<6->{$1$.}
\item<7->  Therefore by the Intermediate Value Theorem $f$ has a root somewhere between $0$ and $1$.
\item<8->  Now suppose that it has more than one root and use Rolle's Theorem to get a contradiction.
\item<9->  Suppose it has two real roots $a$ and $b$.  Then $f(a) = 0 = f(b)$.
\item<10->  $f$ is a polynomial, so it is continuous and differentiable everywhere.
\item<11->  By Rolle's Theorem, there is a $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that \alert<15>{$f'(c) = 0$}.
\item<12-| alert@12-13>  $f'(x) = $ \uncover<13->{$3x^2 + 4$.}
\item<14->  Therefore \alert<15>{$f'(x)$ is always positive}.
\item<15-| alert@15>  Contradiction.
\end{itemize}
