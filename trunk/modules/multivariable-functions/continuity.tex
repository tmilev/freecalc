\begin{definition}[Continuous at a point]
We say that $f$ is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$ if $\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0).$
\end{definition}
\uncover<2->{
\begin{definition}[Continuity]
We say that $f$ is a continuous function if it is continuous at all points where it is defined.

\begin{itemize}
\item<3-> Polynomial functions are continuous.
\item<4-> Sum, difference, product of continuous functions are continuous.
\item<5-> If defined, quotients of continuous are continuous.
\item<6-> Powers, exponentials of continuous functions are continuous.
\item<7-> Compositions of continuous functions are continuous.
\item<8-> A function fails to be continuous if:
\begin{itemize}
\item<9-> (Removable discontinuity) limit exists but is different from f-n value;
\item<10-> (Essential discontinuity) the limit does not exist.
\end{itemize}
