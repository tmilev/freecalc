\begin{itemize}
\item So far, the functions we studied had  one dimensional (scalar) input.
\item Most mathematical models deal with phenomena where the output
depends on several variables.
\item Variables may be ``dependent'' or independent.
\item 
\end{itemize}

hence we need to build and use
functions with multidimensional input; such input is
typically represented as a bundle of scalar variables.
