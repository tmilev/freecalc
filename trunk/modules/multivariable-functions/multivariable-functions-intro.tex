So far all the functions we studied had one
dimensional (scalar) input. Most of the mathematical
models, however, deal with phenomena where the output
depends on several, dependent or independent factors,
hence we need to build and use
functions with multidimensional input; such input is
typically represented as a bundle of scalar variables.
