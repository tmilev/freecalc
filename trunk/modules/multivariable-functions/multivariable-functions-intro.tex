\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item So far, the functions we studied had  one dimensional (scalar) input.
\item<2-> Most mathematical models deal with phenomena where the output
depends on several variables.
\item<3-> Variables may be ``dependent'' or independent - issue dealt with in the subject of probabilities/statistics.
\item<4-> We need to build and use functions with multidimensional input.
\item<5-> Such input is typically represented as a bundle of scalar variables.
\end{itemize}
