So far we have focused our attention on functions with
a scalar output. However, we have already seen examples of
functions with vectorial output, and one such example is
involved in the vectorial parametric equation of a plane.

If $\mathcal{P}$ is the plane through
$P_0(\textbf{r}_0)$ and parallel to directions
$\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$, then the points
of $\mathcal{P}$ have position vectors $\textbf{r}$
satisfying
%
$$\textbf{r} = \textbf{r}_0 + s \textbf{u} +
t \textbf{v}\; ,$$
%
so the function $\bm{f} \colon \RR^2 \to \RR^3$,
$\bm{f}(s,t) = \textbf{r}_0 +
s \textbf{u} + t \textbf{v}$ globally identifies
$\RR^2$ with the plane $\mathcal{P}$.
Each point $P$ of $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds
uniquely to a pair of coordinates $(s,t)$.

Another important example of a function with a
two dimensional input and a three dimensional output is
the following.

\begin{example}{\rm Let $f \colon (0,2\pi)
\times (0,\pi) \to \RR^3$ be given by
%
$$f(t,s) = (R\sin{s}\cos{t}, R\sin{s}\sin{t},
R\cos{s}) \; .$$
%
Then the image of $f$ is a subset of the
sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin.
Which points of the sphere are not covered
by the image of $f$?
