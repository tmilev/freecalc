\begin{itemize}
\item  Newton's Method gives us a sequence $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$ of approximations to a root $r$ of a function $f(x)$.
\item  If the $n$th approximation is $x_n$ and $f'(x_n)\neq 0$, then the $(n+1)$st approximation is
\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]
\item  If the numbers $x_n$ become closer and closer to $r$ as $n$ becomes large, we say that the sequence converges to $r$.
\item  The sequence does not always converge.
\end{itemize}
