Let $S$ be a surface that has implicit equation $F(x,y, z)=0 $ for some differentiable function $F$. Let $P$ be a point on the surface.
\begin{theorem}
Suppose $\nabla F(P)\neq \fcv 0$. Then $\nabla F(P)$ is perpendicular to the tangent vector at $P$ of every differentiable curve lying in $S$ passing through $P$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $\fcv r(t)= \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ is a curve in $S$. Compute:

\fcv r'(t)\cdot \langle F_x, F_y, F_z \rangle _{|x=x(t), y=y(t), z=z(t)}&=&0 \\
\fcv r'(t)\cdot (\nabla F)_{|x=x(t), y=y(t), z=z(t)}&=&0\\

\begin{definition}[Tangent plane to level surface]
Suppose $\nabla F(P)\neq 0$. We define the tangent plane to the surface $S$ at $P$ to be the plane passing through $P$ with normal vector $\nabla F(P)$.
