  Given a function $f$ and a point $P$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the direction in which $f$ increases the fastest from $P$?
  \item What is that maximal rate of increase?
\end{itemize}
%
\pause
\underline{Fact}: If the maximal rate of increase is strictly positive, then it is achieved in exactly one direction. \pause The answers are encoded in a vector.

\begin{definition}
   The \emph{gradient vector} of $f$ at $P$ is the unique vector that has
\begin{itemize}
  \item magnitude equal to the maximal rate of increase of $f$ from $P$.
  \item If the magnitude is not zero, then the direction is the direction in which $f$ increases the fastest from $P$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
%
Notation: $(\nabla f)(P) = (\nabla f)_P = (\textbf{grad} \;f)(P)$

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\nabla f$: gradient vector field \hspace{2cm}
$P \rightsquigarrow (\nabla f)(P)$
%
\item $\nabla$: \emph{del} operator \hspace{2cm}
function $f$ $\rightsquigarrow$ vector field $\nabla f$
\end{itemize}
