\frametitle{(4.7) Optimization Problems}
The methods we have learned for finding extreme values of functions have applicaitons to real life.  

The basic steps are always the same:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Draw a picture of the problem.
\item  Assign variable names to all of the quantities involved.
\item  Find a formula that expresses the desired quantity in terms of the other quantities.
\item  If the desired quantity has been expressed as a function of more than one variable, use formulas to eliminate all but one of these variables.
\item  Now use calculus to find the maximum (or minimum) value of the desired quantity.
\end{enumerate}
