\frametitle{One variable optimization Problems}
The problem of finding minimum/maximum of a differentiable one-variable function often arises in practice.
\uncover<2->{
\begin{problem}[One variable optimization problem statement]
\alertNoH{3}{Given a function $\alertNoH{6}{f(\alertNoH{7}{x})}$}, find the maximum and/or the minimum of $\alertNoH{6}{f(\alertNoH{7}{x})}$, and the values of $\alertNoH{7}{x}$ for which the minima/maxima are achieved.
\end{problem}
}
\uncover<3->{Optimization problems are usually not formulated directly in \alertNoH{3}{the above form}.} \uncover<4->{Solving an optimization problem involves the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item<5->  Draw a picture of the problem. Assign variable names to the involved quantities. \uncover<6->{ Determine \alertNoH{6}{which quantity} is being maximized/minimized.}
\item<7->  Express all involved quantities in terms of \alertNoH{7}{only one of them}. \uncover<8->{If you cannot do that then the problem is not in one variable (i.e., lies outside of the scope of Calculus I).}
\item<9->  Use the closed interval method to find the maximum/minimum value of the desired quantity.
