Recall a parametric curve $\gamma$  was defined as the data
\[
\gamma:
\left| 
\begin{array}{rcl}
x_1&=&f_1(t)\\
x_2&=&f_2(t)\\
&\vdots & \\
x_n&=&f_n(t)
\end{array} \right., t\in [a,b]\quad 
\]
\begin{definition}
A \emph{curve image} (or simply a curve) is any set of points that arises by traversing some \alert<2>{continuous} curve. In other words, a curve image is any set that can be written in the form
\[
\left\{(f_1(t),\dots, f_n(t))~|~ t\in [a,b]\right\}\quad ,
\]
for some \alert<2>{continuous} functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$.
\end{definition}
\only<2>{If we don't require that the functions be continuous, else every set of points will be a curve and the definition would be pointless.}

\uncover<3->{Informally, a curve image ``remembers'' only the points lying on the curve but forgets the ``speed'' with which each point was visited and ``how many times'' each point was visited.
