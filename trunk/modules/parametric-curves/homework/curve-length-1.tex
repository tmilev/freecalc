Plot the curve. Set up an integral that expresses its length. If the integral is of a type which you have studied, solve it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $y=\frac{1}{x}$, $x\in [1, 2]$.
\item 
\begin{equation*}
\gamma:\left| 
\begin{array}{rcl}
x(t)&=&e^t\\
y(t)&=&e^{-t}\\
\end{array}\right., t\in [0,\ln(2)]\quad .
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
