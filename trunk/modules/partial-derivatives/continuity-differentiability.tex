  \underline{Single variable functions}:

  differentiable at a point if and only if it has a derivative at that point.

  \medskip

  has derivative at a point $\Longrightarrow$ is continuous at the point

\pause   \underline{Several variable functions}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $f$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$, then:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$;
    \item $f$ has partial derivatives at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item  If $f$ has partial derivatives at $(x_0,y_0)$ then
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{need not} be differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$;
    \item $f$ \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{need not be even continuous} at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  Source of these problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Partial derivatives at a point take into consideration the behavior of the function along \emph{special directions};
  %
  \item Continuity and differentiability require at least \emph{all directions}.
\end{itemize}

\pause \underline{Positive} result:

\begin{theorem}
   If $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist and are continuous on an open disk, then $f$ is differentiable at all points of that disk.
\end{theorem}

\pause \underline{Consequences}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Polynomial functions are differentiable;
  \item Algebraic combinations of differentiable functions are differentiable.
\end{itemize}
