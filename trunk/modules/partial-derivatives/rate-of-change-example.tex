\begin{itemize}
\item $O$: fixed point in space. Define $\alert<1->{f(P) = |OP|^2}$.
\item<2-> Question: How does $f$ change around a point $P_0$ in space? \uncover<3->{$$\text{Change in } f = f(P) - f(P_0)$$}
\item<4->\alert<1->{Quantitative} question: \pause
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{Rate of change} of $f$ at $P_0$


\end{itemize}

  \pause Ambiguity: \pause Rate of change of $f$ with respect to WHAT?
  %
  $$\text{ Rate of change } = \frac{f(P) - f(P_0)}{??}$$
  %
  \pause Naive answer: \pause With respect to
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,0.00}{distance} from $P_0$
  %
  $$\frac{f(P) - f(P_0)}{|P_0P|}$$
  %
  \pause Problem: \pause
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{instantaneous rate of change}
  %
  $$\lim_{P\to P_0} \frac{f(P)-f(P_0)}{|P_0P|}$$
  %
  does not exist!
