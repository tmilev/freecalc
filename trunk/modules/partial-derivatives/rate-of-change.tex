  $O$: fixed point in space. For $P$ in space:
  $\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{f(P) = |OP|^2}$

  Question: How does $f$ change around a point $P_0$ in space? \pause
  %
  $$\text{Change in } f = f(P) - f(P_0)$$
  %
  \pause \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{Quantitative} question: \pause
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{Rate of change} of $f$ at $P_0$

  \pause Ambiguity: \pause Rate of change of $f$ with respect to WHAT?
  %
  $$\text{ Rate of change } = \frac{f(P) - f(P_0)}{??}$$
  %
  \pause Naive answer: \pause With respect to
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,0.00}{distance} from $P_0$
  %
  $$\frac{f(P) - f(P_0)}{|P_0P|}$$
  %
  \pause Problem: \pause
  \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{instantaneous rate of change}
  %
  $$\lim_{P\to P_0} \frac{f(P)-f(P_0)}{|P_0P|}$$
  %
  does not exist!
