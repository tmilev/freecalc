\label{problemIntegrateBuildingBlockIIaandIIIa} Let $a,b,c,A, B$ be real numbers. Suppose in addition $a\neq 0$ and  $b^2-4ac<0$. Integrate
\[
\int \frac{Ax +B}{ax^2+bx+c}\diff x\quad .
\]

The purpose of this exercise is to produce a formula in form ready for implementation in a computer algebra system.
