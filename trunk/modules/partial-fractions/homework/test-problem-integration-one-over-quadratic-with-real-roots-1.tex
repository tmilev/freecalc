Integrate 
\[
\int \frac{x }{2x^2+x-1}\diff{}x
\]

\solution{
The quadratic in the denominator has real roots and therefore factors using real numbers. Therefore we have to use the partial fractions algorithm.
\[
\begin{array}{rcll|l}
\displaystyle \int \frac{x }{2x^2+x-1}\diff{}x&=&\displaystyle \int \frac{\frac{1}{2}x}{\left( x+1\right)\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)} \diff x &&\text{partial fractions, see below}\\
&=&\displaystyle  \int \frac{\frac{1}{3} }{\left( x+1\right)}\diff {}x +\int \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{ \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)} \diff {}x\\
&=&\displaystyle \frac{1}{3} \ln |x+1|+\frac{1}{6} \ln \left|x-\frac{1}{2}\right| +C\quad .
\end{array}
\]
Here's how the partial fractions are obtained. We aim to decompose into partial fractions the following function (the denominator has been factored). \[\frac{x }{2x^{2}+x -1}=\frac{x }{ \left(x +1\right)\left(2x -1\right)}\]We need to find $A_i$'s so that we have the following equality of rational functions. After clearing denominators, we get the follwing equality. \[x = A_{1} (2x -1)+A_{2} (x +1)\]After rearanging we get that the following polynomial must vanish. Here, by ``vanish'' we mean that the coefficients of the powers of $x$ must be equal to zero.\[(A_{2} +2A_{1} -1)x +(A_{2} -A_{1} )\]In other words, we need to solve the following system. \[\begin{array}{llll} & 2A_{1} & +A_{2} & =1\\ & -A_{1} & +A_{2} & =0\\\end{array}\] \begin{longtable}{cc} System status&Action \\\hline $\begin{array}{llll} & 2A_{1} & +A_{2} & =1\\ & -A_{1} & +A_{2} & =0\\\end{array}$& Selected pivot column 2. Eliminated the non-zero entries in the pivot column. \\\hline $\begin{array}{llll} & A_{1} & +\frac{A_{2} }{2} & =\frac{1}{2}\\ & & \frac{3}{2}A_{2} & =\frac{1}{2}\\\end{array}$& Selected pivot column 3. Eliminated the non-zero entries in the pivot column. \\\hline $\begin{array}{llll} & A_{1} & & =\frac{1}{3}\\ & & A_{2} & =\frac{1}{3}\\\end{array}$& Final result.\\ \end{longtable}Therefore, the final partial fraction decomposition is: \[\frac{\frac{x }{2}}{x^{2}+\frac{x }{2}-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{(x +1)}+\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{(2x -1)}\]
