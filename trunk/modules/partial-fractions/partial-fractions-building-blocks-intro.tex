Let $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ be an arbitrary rational function, i.e., a quotient of polynomials.
\begin{question}
Can we integrate $\displaystyle\int \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx$?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item The answer is Yes. We will now proceed to learn how.
\item The algorithm for integration is roughly:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use algebra to split $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ into partial fractions. 
\item We use linear substitutions to bring each partial fraction integral to one of 4 basic building block integrals.
\item We solve each building block integral and collect the terms.
\end{itemize}
\item We study the algorithm ``from the ground up'': we start with the building blocks.
\end{itemize}
