Let $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ be an arbitrary rational function, i.e., a quotient of polynomials.
\begin{question}
Can we integrate $\displaystyle\int \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\diff x$?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> Yes. We will learn how in what follows.
\item<3-> The algorithm for integration is roughly:
\begin{itemize}
\item<4-> We use algebra to split $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ into smaller pieces (``partial fractions''). 
\item<5-> We use linear substitutions to transform each piece to one of $3$ pairs of basic building block integrals. 
\item<6-> We solve each building block integral and collect the terms.
\end{itemize}
\item<7-> We study the algorithm ``from the ground up'': we start with the building blocks.
\end{itemize}
