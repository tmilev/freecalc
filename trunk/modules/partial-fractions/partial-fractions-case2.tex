Suppose $Q(x)$ is a product of linear factors, some of which appear with power greater than 1.
%\end{enumerate}

Suppose the first linear factor $(a_1x+b_1)$ is repeated $r$ times; that is, $(a_1x+b_1)^r$ occurs in the factorization of $Q(x)$.  Then instead of a single term $A/(a_1x+b_1)$ we would use
\[
\frac{A_1}{a_1x+b_1}%
 + \frac{A_2}{(a_1x+b_1)^2}%
 + \cdots %
 + \frac{A_r}{(a_1x+b_1)^r}%
\]
We make similar adjustments for all other repeating terms $(a_sx+b_s)$.
