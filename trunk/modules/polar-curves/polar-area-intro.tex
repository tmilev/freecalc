\frametitle{(11.4)  Areas and Lengths in Polar Coordinates}
The area $A$ of the region enclosed by the polar curve $r = f(\theta )$, $a\leq \theta \leq b$ is
\[
A = \int_a^b \frac{1}{2}[f(\theta )]^2\diff \theta
\]
A geometric explanation of this formula can be found in the textbook.

It is helpful to think of the area as being swept over by a rotating ray through $O$ that starts with angle $a$ and ends with angle $b$.
