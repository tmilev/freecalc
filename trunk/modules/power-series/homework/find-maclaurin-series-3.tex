Compute the Maclaurin series of the following. If the power series were derived in your study materials, derive them again with ``closed textbook''. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle \Arctan x $.
\item $\sqrt{1+x^2}$.
\item $\arccos (2x)$.
\item $\displaystyle \ln (1+x)$.
\item $\displaystyle \ln (1-x)$.
\item $\ln (1+x^2)$.
\item $e^x$ (for this example just recall the power series, do not derive them).
\item $e^{-x^2}$.
\item $xe^{-x^2}$.
\item $\sin x$ (for this example just recall the power series, do not derive them).
\item $\cos x$ (for this example just recall the power series, do not derive them).
\end{enumerate}
