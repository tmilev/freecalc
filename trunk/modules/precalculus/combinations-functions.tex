\frametitle{Combinations of Functions}
Two functions $f$ and $g$ can be combined to form new functions $f+g$, $f-g$, $fg$, and $f/g$.  The sum and difference functions are defined by the formulas
\[
(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), \qquad (f-g)(x) = f(x)-g(x).
\]
If $A$ is the domain of $f$ and $B$ is the domain of $g$, then the domain of $f+g$ and $f-g$ is $A\cap B$, the intersection of $A$ and $B$.

The product and quotient functions are defined by the formulas
\[
(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x), \qquad \left( \frac{f}{g}\right)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}.
\]
These functions also have the domain $A\cap B$, with one exception: in the quotient function, we aren't allowed to divide by 0, so we must exclude those values of $x$ that make $g(x) = 0$.  We write this domain as
\[
\{ x\in A\cap B | \ g(x) \neq 0\} .
\]
