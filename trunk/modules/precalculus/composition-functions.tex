\begin{definition}[Composition of $f$ and $g$]
If $f$ and $g$ are two functions, then the composition of $f$ and $g$ is written $f\circ g$ and is defined by the formula
\[
(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)).
\]
\end{definition}

Imagine $f$ and $g$ as machines taking some input and producing some output. Then $f\circ g$ corresponds to attaching both machines end-to-end so that the output of $g$ becomes the input of $f$.

\uncover<2->{
The domain of $f\circ g$ is the set of all numbers $x$ in the domain of $g$ such that $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$.  If the domain of $f$ is $A$ and the domain of $g$ is $B$, we write this as
\[
\{ x\in B |\ g(x) \in A\} .
