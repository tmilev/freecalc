The proof of the Quotient Rule uses a trick similar to the one in the proof of the Product Rule.  
\begin{theorem}[The Quotient Rule]
If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable, then
\[
\frac{\diff}{\diff x} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{g(x)\frac{\diff}{\diff x} [f(x)] - f(x) \frac{\diff}{\diff x}[g(x)]}{[g(x)]^2}
\]
\end{theorem}
