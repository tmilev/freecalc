\item Find the maximal possible product of two numbers whose sum is $12$.

\answer{$36$}
\item Two numbers add to 12 and when twice the square of one of them is added to the other, the result is the minimum possible. What are the two numbers?

\answer{$\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{47}{4}$}
\item What is the maximal possible area of a rectangle with perimeter $20m$?

\answer{$25m^2$}
\item Let $L$ be the line with equation $x+y=4$ and let $P$ be the point $(0,1)$. Find the point on $L$ closest to $P$ and find the distance between $P$ and that point.
