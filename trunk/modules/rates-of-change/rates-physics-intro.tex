\begin{itemize}
\item  Suppose $s(t)$ is the position function of a particle moving in a straight line.
\item  $v = \frac{\diff s}{\diff t}$ is its instantaneous velocity (rate of change of displacement with respect to time).
\item<2->  The speed of the particle is how fast it's going.  Speed is never negative.
\item<3->  The velocity of the particle is like its speed, but it takes into account the direction of motion.
\item<4->  Positive velocity means the particle is moving forward.
\item<5->  Negative velocity means the particle is moving backward.
\item<6->  Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
