\item \label{problemRelatedRatesFinddr/dtIfds/dtIsKnownS-sphere} A spherical soap bubble is slowly shrinking. If its surface area is decreasing at a rate of 50 square millimeters per
second, how quickly is the radius decreasing when the surface area is 1000 square millimeters?

\answer{$\frac{\diff r}{\diff t} = - \frac{ 50}{ 8 \pi \sqrt{\frac{250}{\pi}}} =- \frac{ \sqrt{10 } }{8 \sqrt{\pi}}$.}

\item \label{problemRelatedRatesCarAlongEllipticalTrack}A car drives along an elliptical track. The track can be modeled by the equation $x^2 + 5y^2 = 14$, where $x$ and $y$ are 
measured in kilometres of distance from the center of the track. As the car passes the point $(3, 1)$, the $x$-coordinate is 
increasing at a rate of $1.5$ km/min. How quickly is the $y$-coordinate changing at that point?

\answer{$\frac{\diff y}{\diff t} = -\frac{9}{10}$ km/min.}
\item \label{problemRelatedRatesGravelCone} Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a constant rate of $ 500 $ litres per minute. The gravel pile forms a cone with circular base, the diameter of which remains equal to the hight of the cone at any given moment. Use related rates to approximate how fast is the height of the pile increasing when it is 2 meters tall?
\answer{$\frac{\diff h}{\diff t} =  \frac{ 1}{ 2 \pi}$ m/min.}
