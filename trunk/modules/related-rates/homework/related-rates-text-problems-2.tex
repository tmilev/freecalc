\item \label{problemRelatedRatesFinddr/dtIfds/dtIsKnownS-sphere} A spherical soap bubble is slowly shrinking. If its surface area is decreasing at a rate of 50 square millimeters per
second, how quickly is the radius decreasing when the surface area is 1000 square millimeters?

\answer{$\frac{\diff r}{\diff t} = - \frac{ 50}{ 8 \pi \sqrt{\frac{250}{\pi}}} =- \frac{ \sqrt{10 } }{8 \sqrt{\pi}}$.}

\item \label{problemRelatedRatesCarAlongEllipticalTrack}A car drives along an elliptical track. The track can be modeled by the equation $x^2 + 5y^2 = 14$, where $x$ and $y$ are 
measured in kilometers of distance from the center of the track. As the car passes the point $(3, 1)$, the $x$-coordinate is 
increasing at a rate of $1.5$ km/min. How quickly is the $y$-coordinate changing at that point?

\answer{$\frac{\diff y}{\diff t} = -\frac{9}{10}$ km/min.}
