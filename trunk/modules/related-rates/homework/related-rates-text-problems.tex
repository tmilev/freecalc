\solution{
\ref{problemRelatedRatesCubeExpands}. The volume $V$ is given by $V=x^3$, therefore
\[
\frac{\diff V}{\diff t}= \frac{\diff }{\diff t}\left(x^3\right)= 3x^2\frac{\diff x}{\diff t}.
\]

\solution{\ref{problemRelatedRatesSquareExpands}
The area $A$ of the square is given by $A=x^2$, therefore
\[
\frac{\diff A}{\diff t}= \frac{\diff }{\diff t}\left(x^2\right)= 2x\frac{\diff x}{\diff t}.
\]
When $A=9 \text{cm}^2$, $x= 3\text{cm} $ ($=\sqrt{9\text{cm}^2}$), and so $\frac{\diff A}{\diff t}_{|x=3, \frac{\diff x}{\diff t}=1} = 2\cdot 3\text{cm} \cdot 1\text{cm/s} =6\text{cm}^2/\text{s}$.

\solution{\ref{problemRelatedRatesBallSurfaceAreaChanges}
Let $S$ denote the surface area and $r$ the radius of the ball. Then $S=4\pi r^2$. Let the point of time be $t_0$. We are given that $\frac{\diff S}{\diff t}_{|t=t_0}= 5 \text{cm}^2/\text{s}$. On the other hand, 

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{\diff S}{\diff t}&=& \frac{\diff }{\diff t}\left(4\pi r^2\right)= 8\pi r \frac{\diff r}{\diff t}\\
\frac{1}{8\pi}\frac{\diff S}{\diff t}
\end{array}
\]

\solution{\ref{problemRelatedRatesWatchHands}
Let the angle between the two arrows be $\theta$. The cosine law states that  for a triangle with angle $\theta$ and sides $a, b, c$ we have that $c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos \theta$ (where $c$ is the length of the side opposite to the angle $\theta$).

Then by the cosine law, the distance between the tips of the two hands is
1\[ 
y=\sqrt{5^2+10^2+2\cdot 5\cdot 10 \cos  \theta}=\sqrt{125+100 \cos \theta}.
\]

The short hand makes 1 full revolution every 12 hours, and the long hand makes 1 full revolution every 1 hour. Therefore the angle $\theta$ measured from the small hand to the long hand changes at the (constant) rate of $\frac{11}{12}$ revolutions per hour, or what is the same, at the rate $\frac{d \theta}{d t} = \frac{11}{12} (2\pi)=\frac{11}{6}\pi$.

The problem asks us to compute $\frac{d y}{d t}$ at two o'clock, i.e., at $t=2$. This is a straightforward computation using the chain rule:
\[
\begin{array}{rcll|l}
\displaystyle \frac{\diff y}{\diff t}&=&\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} \frac{-100\sin \theta}{ \sqrt{125+100\cos \theta}}\frac{\diff \theta}{\diff t}&&\text{at 2 o'clock } \theta=\frac{\pi}{3} \text{ and } \frac{\diff \theta}{\diff t}=\frac{11}{6} \pi\\~\\
\displaystyle {\frac{\diff y}{\diff t}}_{|t=2}&=&\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} \frac{-100 \sin \frac{\pi}{3} }{ \sqrt{125+100 \cos \frac{\pi}{3}}} \frac{11\pi}{6}=-\frac{55}{42}\sqrt{21} \pi \quad .
\end{array}
\]
The measurement unit of speed is mm/hour, so the distance is changing at the rate of $-\frac{55}{42}\sqrt{21}$ mm/hour.
