\begin{itemize}
\item  Suppose we are pumping a balloon with air.
\item  The balloon's volume is increasing.
\item  The balloon's radius is increasing.
\item  The rates of increase of these quantities are related to one another.
\item<2->  It is easier to measure the rate of increase of volume.
\item<3->  In a related rates problem, we compute the rate of change of one quantity in terms of the rate of change of another (which may be more easily measured).
\item<4->  Procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item<4->  Find an equation relating the two quantities.
\item<4->  Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time.
\end{enumerate}
