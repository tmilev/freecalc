\begin{example}[A finite sequence]
\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

is an example of a finite sequence.  So is
\[
-1, -2, -3, \ldots , -10 000.

\begin{definition}[Finite sequence, Infinite sequence]
A finite sequence is a sequence that ends.  
It is possible to write down all the terms in a finite sequence.  
A sequence that is not finite is called an infinite sequence.
