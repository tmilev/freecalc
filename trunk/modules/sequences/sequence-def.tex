\begin{definition}[Sequence]
A sequence is a list of numbers written in a definite order:
\[
a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots , a_n , \ldots
\]

The number $a_1$ is called the first term, $a_2$ is called the second term, and in general $a_n$ is the $n$th term.

We will always deal with infinite sequences, in which each term $a_n$ has a successor $a_{n+1}$.
\end{definition}

Notation:

The sequence $\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \}$ can also be written
\[
\{ a_n\} \qquad \textrm{ or }\qquad \{ a_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty
\]
