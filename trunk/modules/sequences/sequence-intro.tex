\item We are interested to study sequences such as:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\left(a_1, a_2, a_3\dots\right)\\
\left(1,2,3,\dots\right) \\
\left(1,3,5,7, \dots\right)\\ 
\left(1, -1, 1, -1, \dots\right)\quad .
\end{array}

\begin{definition}[Most general form]
A sequence is an ordered collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.
\end{definition}
}
\item<3-> The definition is too general for our purposes.
\item<4-> For example it allows sequences indexed by the real numbers.
\item<5-> We give a less general (but possibly easier to understand) definition shortly. 
\item<6-> Our less general definition will cover all uses of sequences in the present course/lectures.
\item<7-> We start by a few examples.
