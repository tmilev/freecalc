\begin{question}
How can we define a sequence of numbers $\left(a_1, a_2, a_3 \dots, a_n, \dots \right)$?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item A sequence can be interpreted as a function that takes as arguments a subset of the integers. 
\item Since functions can be defined in exotic and indirect ways, so can sequences. 
\item We will use the three most frequently used ways to define sequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item by specifying a formula for the $n^{th}$ term;
\item by recursion;
\item by specifying a property of integers and constructing a sequence of all integers with that property.
\end{itemize}
