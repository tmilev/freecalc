\begin{definition}[Conditionally Convergent]
A series $\displaystyle \sum a_n$ is called conditionally convergent if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent.
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item<2->  The alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent.
\item<3->  Therefore it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely convergent.
\item<4->  Question: Is it possible for a series to be absolutely convergent but not convergent?
\item<5->  Answer: No.  This is the content of the next theorem.
\end{itemize}
