\begin{example}[A finite series]
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
\]
is an example of a finite series.  So is
\[
-1 - 2 - 3 - \ldots - 10 000.

\begin{definition}[Finite series, Infinite series]
A finite series is a series that ends.  
It is possible to write down all the terms in a finite series.  
A series that is not finite is called an infinite series.  

Every finite series has a sum.  
Some infinite series have a sum, and others do not.  
\end{definition}
