\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Integral Test and Estimates of Sums}
\begin{itemize}
\item  In general, it is not easy to find the sum of a series.
\item  We could do this for $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ because we found a simple formula for the $n$th partial sum $s_n$.
\item  In the next few sections, we'll learn techniques for showing whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly computing its sum.
\end{itemize}
