\begin{theorem}[The Limit Comparison Test]
Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms.  If
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = c
\]
where \alert<handout:0| 2>{$c$ is a finite number and $c > 0$}, then either both series converge or both series diverge.
\end{theorem}
\uncover<2->{%
The main thing to check is that $c$ is finite and non-zero.%
