This theorem summarizes the results of the previous example.
\begin{theorem}[Convergence of Geometric Series]
The geometric series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1} = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots
\]
is convergent if $|r| < 1$ and its sum is
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r}.
\]
If $|r| \geq 1$, the series is divergent.

$a$ is called the first term and $r$ is called the common ratio.
