\begin{frame}{(Suggested) Guidelines for Substitution Method}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Make a choice for the substitution $u=g(x)$.\\
It is usually best to choose the inner most part of a composite function, such as a quantity raised to a power, or more generally, the expression "wrapped in the most brackets".\\
 \pause
\item[2.] Compute $\ds \frac{du}{dx}$ and solve for $dx$.\\ \pause 
\item[3.] Substitute $u$ for $g(x)$ and replace $dx$ with the quantity found in step 2. \pause \\
\item[4.] Simplify the integrand, then if the integrand no longer has any $x$'s, integrate with respect to $u$.  (If $x$'s remain  after simplifying or if integrating is not possible, then try another substitution).\pause \\
\item[5.] Replace $u$ with $g(x)$ to obtain the integral in terms of $x$.\pause \\
\item[6.] (optional) Check your answer  by differentiating.
\end{itemize}
