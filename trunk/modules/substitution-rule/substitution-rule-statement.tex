This approach works more generally, and is called the Substitution Rule.
\begin{theorem}[The Substitution Rule]
If $u = g(x)$ is a differentiable function whose range is an interval $I$ and $f$ is continuous on $I$, then
\[
\int f(g(x)) g'(x) \ \diff x = \int f(u)\ \diff u
\]
\end{theorem}
This is the opposite of the Chain Rule.
