Use Pappus' theorem to find the surfacea area of a sphere of radius $R$.

\uncover<2->{
$C$: semicircle of radius $R$, rotated about axis joining endpoints

resulting surface is a sphere of radius $R$ and area $4\pi R^2$.

length of $C$ is $\pi R$;

the centroid travels a distance of $4R$;

the centroid is at a distance of $\frac{2R}{\pi}$ from the axis.
