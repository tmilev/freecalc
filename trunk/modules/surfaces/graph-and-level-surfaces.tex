  \frametitle{Graph Surface vs. Level Surface}

A surface $S$ can be given in a number of ways. Two such ways are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \pause Explicit form, as a \emph{graph surface}:
  %
  $$z=f(x,y)$$
%
  \item \pause Implicit form, as a \emph{level surface}:
  %
  $$F(x,y,z) = k$$
  %
\end{itemize}

\pause
A graph surface $z=f(x,y)$ can always be represented as a level surface:
%
$$z=f(x,y) \Longleftrightarrow F(x,y,z) =0 \quad \text{ for } \quad F(x,y,z) = z-f(x,y)\; .$$

\underline{Question}: Can a given level surface be represented as a graph surface?
