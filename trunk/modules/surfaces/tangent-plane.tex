  \frametitle{Tangent Plane}

Given a surface $S$ in space and a point $P$ on the surface.

\bigskip

\underline{Question:} What should be the geometric plane tangent to $S$ at $P$?

\pause
\bigskip

\underline{Intuitively}: It should include all vectors tangent at $P$ to curves passing through $P$ and contained in the surface.

\bigskip

\underline{Equivalently}: It should be the geometric plane
\begin{itemize}
  \item passing through $P$;
  \item parallel to the directions of all tangent vectors of curves passing through $P$ and contained in the surface.
\end{itemize}
