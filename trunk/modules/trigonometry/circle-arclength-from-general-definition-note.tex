\frametitle{Arc-length of a circle arc}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a definition of arc-length of arbitrary smooth curve.
\item<2-> The definition states that the arc-length of a smooth curve is the \alertNoH{2-6}{limit of the lengths of ever finer straight line approximations}. 
\item<7-> The details of how this is done require integrals and we postpone this for later/another course.
\item<8-> Until then we ask the reader to think of arc-length of a curve as the quantity obtained by ``aligning a rope along the curve'' and measuring the ``length of this rope''.
