\begin{itemize}
\item Some problems will not ask you to prove a trigonometric identity, but rather to solve a trigonometric equation. 
\item Consider the problem  of finding all values of $x$ for which $\sin x = \sin (2x) =2\sin x\cos x$. 
\item This is not a trigonometric identity - the two sides are different. 
\item However, there are values for $x$ which the above equality holds. 
\end{itemize}
