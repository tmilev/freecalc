Recall that a regular tetrahedron can be realized using 4 vertices of a cube. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a regular tetrahedron, find the angle between two edges that  share a common vertex. 
\answer{$\frac{\pi}{3}=60^\circ$.}
\item In a regular tetrahedron, find the angle between two edges that  share a common vertex. 
\answer{$ \frac{\pi}{2}=90^\circ $.}
\end{enumerate}
