A tetrahedron is a pyramid whose base is a triangle. The 8 points $(1,1,1)$, $(-1,1,1)$, $(1,-1,1)$, $(-1,-1,1)$, $(1,1,-1)$, $(-1,1,-1)$, $(1,-1,-1)$, $(-1,-1,-1)$ (all possible sign combinations) give the vertices of a cube with edge 2 units. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find 4 vertices of the cube so they form a regular tetrahedron, i.e., 4 points that are not in the same plane and such that the distance between any two is equal.
\item Form two vectors, $\fcv u$ and $\fcv v$, by connecting the origin with any two of the 4 points you found.
\item Find the angle between $\fcv u$ and $\fcv v$.
\item What is the angle between the two bonds of hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule $CH_4$?
\answer{$ \Arccos \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)\approx 109.471207^\circ$}
\end{enumerate}
