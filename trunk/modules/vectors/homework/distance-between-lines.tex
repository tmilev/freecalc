Find the distance between the lines.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The line passing through $Q_0(1,2,3) $ and $Q_1(2,3,5)$ and the line passing through $P_0(3,5,7)$ and $P_1(5,7,11)$.
\item The line passing through $ Q_0(1,1,1)$ and $Q_1(-1,-1,-1)$ and the line passing through $P_0(1, -1, -1)$ and $P_1(-1,1,-1)$.
\end{enumerate}
