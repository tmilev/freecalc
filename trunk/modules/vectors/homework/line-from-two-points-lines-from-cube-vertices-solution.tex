\solution{\ref{problemEquationsAllDiagonalsCubeContainingOrigin}.
A cube has a total of $8 $ vertices. A line is given by two (distinct) points, therefore there are $\binom {8}{2}= \frac{8\cdot 7}{2}= 28$ total lines connecting two distinct vertices of a cube. Of those $12$ lines are cube edges, $12 = 6\cdot 2$ are diagonals of cube faces, and $4 $ are inner diagonals. All four inner diagonals contain the origin. A justification for this can undoubtedly be given by writing all $28$ line equations. However, the origin is in the center of the cube, and we know from our every-day geometric intuition that only the inner diagonals contain the center of a cube; we give no further justification.

The $4$ inner diagonals of the cube, call them $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$ pass through the points

$\begin{array}{rcl}
(1,1,1), (-1,-1,-1) &\in& L_1\\
(1,1,-1), (-1,-1,1) &\in& L_2\\
(1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) &\in& L_3\\
(-1,1,1), (1,-1,-1) &\in& L_4
\end{array}.
$

Therefore equations for these lines are given by:
$
\begin{array}{rl}
L_1:&  t( 1, 1, 1 )\\
L_2:&  t( 1, 1, -1 )\\
L_3:&  t( 1, -1, 1 )\\
L_3:&  t( -1, 1, 1 )\\
\end{array}
$.
