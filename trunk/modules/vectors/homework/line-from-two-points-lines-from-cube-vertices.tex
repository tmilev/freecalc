\label{problemEquationsAllDiagonalsCubeContainingOrigin}
We recall that the 8 points $(1,1,1), (-1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), (1,1,-1)$, $(-1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,-1)$ (all possible sign combinations) give the vertices of a cube with edge 2 units.
 
Find equations for all lines connecting two vertices in the cube above that pass through the origin (how many connecting two vertices of a cube are there? How many of them are edges?).


\answer{ There are $4$ such edges. See the solution below for their equations.
