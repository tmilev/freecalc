 We recall that the 8 points $(1,1,1), (-1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), (1,1,-1)$, $(-1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,-1)$ (all possible sign combinations) give the vertices of a cube with edge 2 units.
 
 Find equations for all lines connecting two vertices in the cube above that pass through the origin (how many such lines are there?).
