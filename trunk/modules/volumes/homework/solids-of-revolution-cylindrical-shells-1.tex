\begin{enumerate}
% Volumes by cylindrical shells
\item Consider the region bounded by the curves $y=\sqrt{x}$, $x=0$, $y=2$. Use the method of cyllindrical shells to find the volume of
the solid obtained by rotating this region about the $x$-axis. 
\answer{$8\pi$}
\item Consider the region bounded by the vurves $y=x^2$ and $y=2-x^2$. Use the method of cylindrical shells to find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating this region about the line $x=1$.
\answer{$16\frac{\pi}{3}$}
