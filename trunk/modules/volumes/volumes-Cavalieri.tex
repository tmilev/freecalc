\frametitle{Cavalieri's principle}
 {\it{Solids with equal cross-sectional areas have equal volume.}} \\
It is often illustrated convincingly with two stacks of coins.

 Our formula 
\[
V=\int_a^bA(x)dx
\]
implies the truth of Cavalieri's principle, since the volumes $V$ are certainly 
equal if the cross-sectional areas $A(x)$ are equal.
